abstract = {Capturing CO2 from large-scale power generation combustion systems such as fluidized bed combustors (FBCs) may become important in a CO2-constrained world. Using previous experience in capturing pollutants such as SO2 in these systems, we discuss a range of options that incorporate capture of CO2 with CaO in FBC systems. Natural limestones emerge from this study as suitable high-temperature sorbents for these systems because of their low price and availability. This is despite their limited performance as regenerable sorbents. We have found a range of process options that allow the sorbent utilization to maintain a given level of CO2 separation efficiency, appropriate operating conditions, and sufficiently high power generation efficiencies. A set of reference case examples has been chosen to discuss the critical scientific and technical issues of sorbent performance and reactor design for these novel CO2 capture concepts.},

abstract = {Due to fast urbanization and increasing living standards, the environmental sustainability of our global society becomes more and more questionable. In this historical review we investigate the role of resources management (RM) and urban planning (UP) and propose ways for integration in sustainable development (SD). RM follows the principle of circular causation, and we reflect on to what extent RM has been an element for urban planning. Since the existence of the first settlements, a close relationship between RM, urbanization and technological development has been present. RM followed the demand for urban resources like water, energy, and food. In history, RM has been fostered by innovation and technology developments and has driven population growth and urbanization. Recent massive resource demand, especially in relation to energy and material flows, has altered natural ecosystems and has resulted in environmental degradation. UP has developed separately in response to different questions. UP followed the demand for improved living conditions, often associated to safety, good manufacturing and trading conditions and appropriate sanitation and waste management. In history UP has been a developing research area, especially since the industrial era and the related strong urbanization at the end of the 18th century. UP responded to new emerging problems in urban areas and became increasingly complex. Nowadays, UP has to address many objectives that are often conflicting, including, the urban sustainability. Our current urban un-sustainability is rooted in massive resource consumption and waste production beyond natural limits, and the absence of flows from waste to resources. Therefore, sustainable urban development requires integration of RM into UP. We propose new ways to this integration.},

abstract = {The urbanisation process has exceeded the traditional pace of human settlement and is moving towards the formation of large urban regions in response to an increasing demand for services and environmental goods, combined with increasing production of waste and emissions. Therefore, it is fundamental to determine resource flows into cities, especially in developing countries, as well as the transformations that occur and the outputs that are produced, such as products, services and wastes. In this study, we apply urban material flow analysis, which determines the flows of inputs (water, energy, food and others) and outputs (wastewater, air pollution, wastes and others) to the city of Bogot\'{a}, Colombia to determine the relationship between demand for resources and the environmental impact of outputs. Quantitative and qualitative data for Bogot\'{a} are used to assess and compare the material and energy flow trends for this city. The results indicate that in this city, inputs and outputs are directly and linearly related. Consumption of energy and construction materials has increased, whereas food and water consumption have remained steady. Levels of recycling and sewage treatment are low, and emissions such as particulate matter have decreased. The findings from this study can be used to formulate and apply policies and strategies to improve the sustainability of resources, decrease the reliance on physical resources, increase the efficiency of resource and energy use in urban areas, and enhance sustainable production and consumption in cities.},

The content underscores the recognition of the pressing and inescapable need for making changes from unsustainable to sustainable production and consumption patterns. The 48 articles from 15 countries provide different, but complimentary approaches to help industrial and societal sectors in advancing on their paths towards sustainability. Initiatives and challenges are included, which systematically address problems affecting raw material changes, technological modifications, product and policy changes. The findings range from proposals for alternative uses of wastes, substitution of raw materials for environmentally friendlier substances, optimization of industrial processes by source reductions of wastes and emissions and documented economic and environmental advantages of a wide array of initiatives. The roles of operational and managerial practices are also stressed, highlighting the role of diverse stakeholders as promoters of implementation and internalization of innovative cleaner technologies within companies. Systemic assessment tools are employed and experimented with in order to more effectively evaluate the environmental performance of systems on the biosphere scale. The methodological procedures and proposals presented can help in the design and management of production systems, for governmental and corporate policy development, for implementing and monitoring CP Programs, prevention and mitigation strategies, and evaluation of the outcomes of CP initiatives in the production and service sectors.},

@article{Alvarenga2012,
abstract = {Environmental variables are increasingly being used in decision-making. An important way to generate environmental information involves Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), methodology that measures the environmental impacts of a product throughout its life cycle. Parallel to this, Wackernagel and Rees developed a methodology to assess the environmental sustainability of regions, the Ecological Footprint (EF) method. Recently, this methodology has also been applied to product evaluations. It is believed that there are differences in the interpretation of the results when using the EF method compared to LCA methods. Therefore, the objective of this work was to compare the different interpretation that can be obtained from CML 2001 and EF, using a case study of four scenarios of broiler feed production in Brazil. The inventory was collected with secondary data, and the main difference among the four scenarios was the origin of the maize and soybeans used (the center-west and south regions of Brazil). As a result, the worst scenario (with maize and soybeans from the center-west) and the best scenario (with maize and soybeans from the south) were the same for both methods, although the second and the third rankings were different. Additionally, we observed that different hotspots were identified. CML (modified) and EF were similar from a broad point of view, but higher differences emerged between them when a deeper analysis was considered. We conclude that the use of EF is not suitable for the agricultural sector, since misleading decisions can be taken as a result of neglecting some important environmental impacts (e.g.: eutrophication and acidification) for this economic sector.},

abstract = {Contaminants cause a decrease in the quality of materials with each recycling step. These quality losses should be minimized to increase the sustainability of resources use. Quality losses cannot be measured using weight-based recovery definitions alone, as the quality degradation cannot be translated by mass measures. Therefore, a better measure of the efficiency of resource use is investigated in the present work. Exergy is a measure of the quality of the energy and of resources in systems. The exergy losses are a thermodynamic measure of exhaustion and thus, of the quality losses in the resource systems. We describe a method to calculate the exergy content and exergy losses of metals during recovery and recycling of a concept car. The exergy losses attributed to recycling (the pollution with other metals) and the consequent need for dilution can be used as indicators of the quality loss of materials and of the efficiency of resource use in product systems.},

abstract = {In this study we investigate how indicators for energy use are applied in a set of life cycle assessment (LCA) and energy analysis case studies of biofuels. We found five inherently different types of indicators to describe energy use: (1) fossil energy, (2) secondary energy, (3) cumulative energy demand, (4) net energy balance, and (5) total extracted energy. It was also found that the examined reports and articles, the choice of energy use indicator was seldom motivated or discussed in relation to other energy use indicators. In order to investigate the differences between these indicators, they were applied to a case. The life cycle energy use of palm oil methyl ester was calculated and reported using these five different indicators for energy use, giving considerably different output results. This is in itself not unexpected, but indicates the importance of clearly identifying, describing and motivating the choice of energy use indicator. The indicators can all be useful in specific situations, depending on the goal and scope of the individual study, but the choice of indicators need to be better reported and motivated than what is generally done today.},

The impact of the emissions due to the life cycle of the buildings has been evaluated. Two thermodynamic indexes, $\eta$I and $\eta$II showing, respectively, the first and second law efficiency of buildings, have been proposed as thermodynamic indexes. The applied methodology provides a single thermodynamics environmental criterion for the selection of technological alternatives, strategies and designs that produce lower environmental impacts connected to higher exergy indexes $\eta$II.},

During this time information was gathered on the waste input material, the biogas production, and the digestate characteristics. A mass balance accounted for over 90\% of the material entering the plant leaving as gaseous or digestate products. A comprehensive energy balance for the same period showed that for each tonne of input material the potential recoverable energy was 405 kWh. Biogas production in the digester was stable at 642 m3 tonne(-1) VS added with a methane content of around 62\%. The nitrogen in the food waste input was on average 8.9 kg tonne(-1). This led to a high ammonia concentration in the digester which may have been responsible for the accumulation of volatile fatty acids that was also observed.},

abstract = {Biofuels derived from microalgae have the potential to replace petroleum fuel and first-generation biofuel, but the efficacy with which sustainability goals can be achieved is dependent on the lifecycle impacts of the microalgae-to-biofuel process. This study proposes a detailed, industrial-scale engineering model for the species Nannochloropsis using a photobioreactor architecture. This process level model is integrated with a lifecycle energy and greenhouse gas emission analysis compatible with the methods and boundaries of the Argonne National Laboratory GREET model, thereby ensuring comparability to preexisting fuel-cycle assessments. Results are used to evaluate the net energy ratio (NER) and net greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) of microalgae biodiesel in comparison to petroleum diesel and soybean-based biodiesel with a boundary equivalent to "well-to-pump". The resulting NER of the microalgae biodiesel process is 0.93 MJ of energy consumed per MJ of energy produced. In terms of net GHGs, microalgae-based biofuels avoids 75 g of CO(2)-equivalent emissions per MJ of energy produced. The scalability of the consumables and products of the proposed microalgae-to-biofuels processes are assessed in the context of 150 billion liters (40 billion gallons) of annual production.},

abstract = {Despite a century of effort, our understanding of how cities evolve is still woefully inadequate. Recent research, however, suggests that cities are complex systems that mainly grow from the bottom up, their size and shape following well-defined scaling laws that result from intense competition for space. An integrated theory of how cities evolve, linking urban economics and transportation behavior to developments in network science, allometric growth, and fractal geometry, is being slowly developed. This science provides new insights into the resource limits facing cities in terms of the meaning of density, compactness, and sprawl, and related questions of sustainability. It has the potential to enrich current approaches to city planning and replace traditional top-down strategies with realistic city plans that benefit all city dwellers.},

The greatest difficulties to any scientific approach to cities have resulted from their many interdependent facets, as social, economic, infrastructural, and spatial complex systems that exist in similar but changing forms over a huge range of scales. Here, I show how all cities may evolve according to a small set of basic principles that operate locally. A theoretical framework was developed to predict the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities as a set of scaling relations that apply to all urban systems. Confirmation of these predictions was observed for thousands of cities worldwide, from many urban systems at different levels of development. Measures of urban efficiency, capturing the balance between socioeconomic outputs and infrastructural costs, were shown to be independent of city size and might be a useful means to evaluate urban planning strategies.},

abstract = {Humanity has just crossed a major landmark in its history with the majority of people now living in cities. Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease. The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from patent production and personal income to electrical cable length are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling exponents, beta, that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities reflecting wealth creation and innovation have beta approximately 1.2 >1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure display beta approximately 0.8 <1 (economies of scale). We predict that the pace of social life in the city increases with population size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which beta<1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse.},

abstract = {The reversible reaction between CaO and CO2 is an extremely promising method of removing CO2 from the exhaust of a power station, generating a pure stream of CO2 ready for geological sequestration. The technology has attracted a great deal of attention recently, owing to a number of its advantages: the relatively small efficiency penalty which it imposes upon a power station (estimated at 6-8 percentage points, including compression of the CO2); its potential use in large-scale circulating fluidised beds (a mature technology, as opposed to the vastly upscaled solvent scrubbing towers which would be required for amine scrubbing); its excellent opportunity for integration with cement manufacture (potentially decarbonising both industries) and its extremely cheap sorbent (crushed limestone). Unfortunately, sorbent (CaO) derived from natural limestone markedly decreases in its reactivity over a number of cycles of reaction with CO2. Much current and promising research involves the investigation of a number of different methods to either reduce the rate of decay in reactivity, to boost the long-term reactivity of the sorbent or to reactivate the sorbent. Technologies investigated include thermal pretreatment or chemical doping of natural sorbents and the production of artificial sorbents. Attrition of the limestone can be a problem during repeated cycling in, e.g. a circulating fluidised bed, and some of the strategies to enhance the long-term capacity of the limestone to take up CO2 can increase attrition. Strategies to counteract attrition, such as pelletisation of highly reactive materials, have succeeded in reducing, though not eliminating, this problem. Each of these topics is reviewed in detail here, as are potential competing reactions with sulphurous compounds and the large-scale integration of the calcium looping cycle with both a power station and a cement works, including a number of assessments of the economics of the cycle. A number of pilot plants demonstrating the technology have been constructed around the world. No major problems have been encountered thus far, and so calcium looping technology is currently moving to the demonstration scale in a number of locations. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

By measuring water exchanges between different sectors of activity within the municipal borders, and considering underground and surface waters as natural components of this system, a network of flows is built and successively investigated by network analysis, a tool that is comprised in the apparatus of ecosystem ecology. By calculating the reciprocal dependence of compartments, the amount of resource that is involved in cycling, the length of exchange pathways, and the organization of flows, network analysis shows that the system does not use water in a sustainable manner and provides general criteria for improving sustainability. In this respect, options to improve sustainability are also discussed. The results of this study support the idea that the ecosystem approach can provide an interesting conceptual perspective in which sustainability issues can be framed, and that network analysis is a promising tool to handle these issues in practice.},

abstract = {With the growing environmental concern, there is evidence that increasing symbiotic relationship between plants in the same industrial area, highly contributes to a more sustainable development of industrial activities. The concept of industrial ecology extended to the terms of eco-industrial park (or ecopark) or industrial symbioses is the topic of extensive research since the five last years. More particularly, even if a lot of ecopark examples and realizations already exist throughout the world, a lot of ecopark proposals are in progress but not achieved. Recently, this vision leads the research community to focus on works proposing methods to optimize the exchanges of an ecopark prior to its design and construction. We find it especially interesting for the scientific community to propose a detailed paper review focused on optimization works devoted to the design of eco industrial parks. This paper is based on a comprehensive literature search in Web of Science database for publications that listed ‘industrial symbiosis’ (or ‘eco industrial park’, or ‘inter plant integration’) and ‘optimization’. This study is segmented into different sections with first, a description of the different concepts evoked in the literature. Then, the several types of networking in an eco-industrial park are detailed in association with the optimization methods employed to solve each problem. The following sections reviews the different objective functions that are formulated to optimally design an eco-industrial park. The last part of the paper is devoted to a critical analysis of the state of the art by proposing several routes to improve the methodologies found in the literature. Another aim of this paper review consists in finding the gaps existing in previous studies. These major gaps are found to be: the lack of multiobjective optimization studies, the absence of social/societal objectives formulation also needs to be addressed and the lack of works taking into account flexibility of ecoparks in an operational point of view.},

The first step of the design method involves four criteria to be taken into account., ie, fresh water consumption (F1), energy consumption (F2), interconnection number (F3) and number of heat exchangers (F4). The multiobjective optimization Min [F1, F2] is solved by the so-called ɛ-constraint method and leads to several Pareto fronts for fixed numbers of connections and heat exchangers. The second step consists in improving the best results of the first phase with energy integration into the water network. This stage is solved by an MINLP procedure in order to minimize an objective cost function. Two examples reported in the dedicated literature serve as test bench cases to apply the proposed two-step approach. The results show that the simultaneous consideration of the abovementioned objectives is more realistic than the only minimization of fresh water consumption. Indeed, the optimal network does not necessarily correspond to the structure that reaches the fresh water target. For a real paper mill plant, energy consumption decreases of almost 20\% as compared with previous studies.},

abstract = {This issue of the Journal of Cleaner Production is based upon papers presented at the 1st International Workshop Advances in Cleaner Production (CP) held in S\~{a}o Paulo, Brazil, in 2007. The conference had the short-term purpose of deepening the Brazilian discussion on “The Roles of Cleaner Production in the Sustainable Development of Modern Societies”, and it had the long-term objective of providing an on-going interdisciplinary forum for knowledge development and exchange on Cleaner Production (CP) and Sustainable Development. This issue is devoted to papers covering a broad range of perspectives of CP practices and strategies. A special focus is placed upon methodological tools designed to support effective decision-making pertaining to quantitative benefits from CP. The ten papers provide insights from research designed to holistically integrate CP to help society make effective progress to sustainability. Papers cover the importance of informal knowledge, as complementary to formal knowledge, in performing effective ‘Environmental Impact Assessments.’ One paper explores the roles of radical and incremental innovation in the context of alternative automotive technologies. Benefits of Ecodesign are explored in two papers; one concerning its integration with remanufacturing to extend the life of used products and one focusing the adoption of ‘Emergy Environmental Accounting,’ as a complementary decision-making tool. The development of the Brazilian LCI database for ‘hydroelectric power generation’ and its contribution to support regionally relevant LCA studies is highlighted in one paper. The complete production chains of biodiesel and bioethanol are evaluated by using global methodologies, which help in the development of more objective and effective solutions. A “compensatory area”, calculated in terms of emergy, is proposed in order to work in a sustainable way for bamboo production. Finally, a paper about a novel approach for recycling used PET is also included.},

Due to a short projected term of availability of the copper, zinc and lead resources (20–30 years) and unavoidable consumption of primary energy (oil, coal, natural gas) the problem of efficiency and economics of the currently used and future technologies is important. It is important that the metallurgy industry is efficient because it can be a significant contribution to Gross National Product and energy consumption in countries where metal production occurs. For example, to get the maximum value from copper deposits, the proper and most efficient technology (of many) should be chosen. The authors proposed a minimum value of Cumulative Exergy Consumption (CExC) as the criterion for the recommended technology. Based on this criterion we conclude that, for example, pure copper cathode production by flash smelting technology is the best technology.},

abstract = {This paper analyses different alternatives for solid waste management that can be implemented to enable the targets required by the European Landfill and Packaging and Packaging Waste Directives to be achieved in the Valencian Community, on the east coast of Spain. The methodology applied to evaluate the environmental performance of each alternative is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The analysis has been performed at two levels; first, the emissions accounted for in the inventory stage have been arranged into impact categories to obtain an indicator for each category; and secondly, the weighting of environmental data to a single unit has been applied. Despite quantitative differences between the results obtained with four alternative impact assessment methods, the same preference ranking has been established: scenarios with energy recovery (1v and 2v) achieve major improvements compared to baseline, with scenario 1v being better than 2v for all impact assessment methods except for the EPS'00 method, which obtains better results for scenario 2v. Sensitivity analysis has been used to test some of the assumptions used in the initial life cycle inventory model but none have a significant effect on the overall results. As a result, the best alternative to the existing waste management system can be identified.},

abstract = {This paper aims to measure raw material inputs and waste flows in an Irish city-region in order to analyse (i) whether there was absolute dematerialisation in the particular case study over the period 1992–2002 and (ii) whether material consumption and waste generation were decoupled from economic growth and increases in disposable income over the same period. It was found that the selected material flow indicators showed no evidence of absolute dematerialisation over the given study period, although more recent evidence at the national level suggests that a decline in construction activity and extraction of non-metallic minerals has resulted in an absolute reduction in material consumption and it is likely that this will be mirrored at the system boundary level. It was found that Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) per capita and Direct Material Input (DMI) per capita increased at a faster rate than Domestic Processed Output (DPO) per capita and Direct Material Output (DMO) per capita between 1992 and 2002, which indicates relative decoupling of consumption from waste generation. In addition, it was found that there was relative decoupling of consumption and waste generation from disposable income growth over the study period. Finally, it was found that average DMC and DMI figures for the selected case study were lower than the national averages but broadly similar to results for other city-regions in the European Union (EU). On a methodological note, it was concluded that material flow accounting (MFA) for city-regions in Ireland is constrained due to a lack of disaggregated data for material flows, with the exception of local waste data, and it is recommended that bottom-up analysis should be used to complement disaggregated top-down data.},

abstract = {Thermoelectric generation contributes to 80\% of global electricity production. Cooling of thermoelectric plants is often achieved by water abstractions from the natural environment. In England and Wales, the electricity sector is responsible for approximately half of all water abstractions and 40\% of non-tidal surface water abstractions. We present a model that quantifies current water use of the UK electricity sector and use it to test six decarbonisation pathways to 2050. The pathways consist of a variety of generation technologies, with associated cooling methods, water use factors and cooling water sources. We find that up to 2030, water use across the six pathways is fairly consistent and all achieve significant reductions in both carbon and water intensity, based upon a transition to closed loop and hybrid cooling systems. From 2030 to 2050 our results diverge. Pathways with high levels of carbon capture and storage result in freshwater consumption that exceeds current levels (37–107\%), and a consumptive intensity that is 30–69\% higher. Risks to the aquatic environment will be intensified if generation with carbon capture and storage is clustered. Pathways of high nuclear capacity result in tidal and coastal abstraction that exceed current levels by 148–399\%. Whilst reducing freshwater abstractions, the marine environment will be impacted if a shortage of coastal sites leads to clustering of nuclear reactors and concentration of heated water discharges. The pathway with the highest level of renewables has both lowest abstraction and consumption of water. Freshwater consumption can also be minimised through use of hybrid cooling, which despite marginally higher costs and emissions, would reduce dependence on scarce water resources thus increase security of supply.},

abstract = {As conventional heterotrophic systems, cities usually depend on water-intensive products through external trade. However, related studies on virtual water are yet far from enough to comprehensively quantify the real water balance of cities. The gap between direct water input and real water demand of a city is demonstrated in the present study by a case study for Macao in the past decade after the sovereignty handover. With the latest virtual water intensity databases, the virtual water embodied in external trade is systematically analyzed. For virtual water embodied in goods, mainland China holds the position as Macao's biggest importer, and the USA outpaces Hong Kong to be the biggest exporter. Virtual water embodied in gaming service dominates that of exported services while household final consumption expenditure abroad contributes the largest share of virtual water embodied in imported services. Despite of fluctuation, virtual water consumed by Macao has increased by about 1.5 folds. As a typical net virtual water importer, Macao has a heavy dependency over 99\% on external water resources. Per capita virtual water consumption of Macao is similar to that of developed countries. The comparatively low virtual water intensity is in accordance with the reality of a service dominated economy.},

abstract = {Cities are considered major contributors to global warming, where carbon emissions are highly embedded in the overall urban metabolism. To examine urban metabolic processes and emission trajectories we developed a carbon flux model based on Network Environ Analysis (NEA). The mutual interactions and control situation within the urban ecosystem of Vienna were examined, and the system-level properties of the city's carbon metabolism were assessed. Regulatory strategies to minimize carbon emissions were identified through the tracking of the possible pathways that affect these emission trajectories. Our findings suggest that indirect flows have a strong bearing on the mutual and control relationships between urban sectors. The metabolism of a city is considered self-mutualistic and sustainable only when the local and distal environments are embraced. Energy production and construction were found to be two factors with a major impact on carbon emissions, and whose regulation is only effective via ad-hoc pathways. In comparison with the original life-cycle tracking, the application of NEA was better at revealing details from a mechanistic aspect, which is crucial for informed sustainable urban management.},

abstract = {Understanding Urban Metabolism addresses the gap between the bio-physical sciences and urban planning and illustrates the advantages of accounting for urban metabolism issues in urban design decisions. Urban metabolism considers a city as a system, and distinguishes between energy and material flows as its components. Based on research from the BRIDGE project, this book deals with how the urban surface exchanges and transforms energy, water, carbon and pollutants in cities. This book also introduces a new method for evaluating how planning alternatives can modify the physical flows of urban metabolism components and how environmental and socioeconomic components interact. The inclusion of sustainability principles into urban planning provides an opportunity to place the new knowledge provided by bio-physical sciences at the centre of the planning process, but there is a strong need to bridge knowledge and practice, as well as for a better dissemination of research results and exchange of best practice. This book meets that need and provides the reader with the necessary tools to integrate an understanding of urban metabolism into urban planning practice.},

abstract = {Urban metabolism considers a city as a system with flows of energy and material between it and the environment. Recent advances in bio-physical sciences provide methods and models to estimate local scale energy, water, carbon and pollutant fluxes. However, good communication is required to provide this new knowledge and its implications to endusers (such as urban planners, architects and engineers). The FP7 project BRIDGE (sustainaBle uRban plannIng Decision support accountinG for urban mEtabolism) aimed to address this gap by illustrating the advantages of considering these issues in urban planning. The BRIDGE Decision Support System (DSS) aids the evaluation of the sustainability of urban planning interventions. The Multi Criteria Analysis approach adopted provides a method to cope with the complexity of urban metabolism. In consultation with targeted end-users, objectives were defined in relation to the interactions between the environmental elements (fluxes of energy, water, carbon and pollutants) and socioeconomic components (investment costs, housing, employment, etc.) of urban sustainability. The tool was tested in five case study cities: Helsinki, Athens, London, Florence and Gliwice; and sub-models were evaluated using flux data selected. This overview of the BRIDGE project covers the methods and tools used to measure and model the physical flows, the selected set of sustainability indicators, the methodological framework for evaluating urban planning alternatives and the resulting DSS prototype.},

abstract = {A central theme of industrial ecology (IE) is the idea of using the cyclical resource-use patterns observed in mature, biological ecosystems as a model for designing increasingly mature ‘industrial ecosystems’ whose productivity relies less on resource extraction and waste emission. In this two part series, we will use a thermodynamic interpretation of ecosystem evolution to strengthen this biological–industrial (B–I) ecosystem analogy. We begin by describing limitations in the current analogy and discussing resulting implications for the development and implementation of IE principles. We propose that these limitations arise largely from a poor definition of resource consumption. We then show that defining resource consumption as a process of removing exergy from a resource provides a basis for interpreting ecosystem evolution as a process of allowing consumption to occur with decreasing levels of depletion, i.e., a process of ‘de-linking’ consumption and depletion. We use thermodynamic principles to deduce the limitations and interrelation of several strategies for de-linking consumption and depletion. Lastly, we explore the benefits and limitations of using the proposed interpretation of ecosystem evolution as an analogy for the development of industrial systems.},

In Part 2, we express resource depletion rate as a product of consumption rate and the Depletion number (Dp)—a non-dimensional indicator of depletion per unit consumption. We introduce two generalized models of resource use that incorporate a choice between virgin resource extraction and post-consumption resource recycling. These models are used as a basis for expressing Dp as a function of non-dimensional indicators for three resource conservation strategies: exergy cycling fraction ($\psi$) for resource recycling, exergy efficiency ($\phi$) for process efficiency gains, and renewed exergy fraction ($\Omega$) for extent of renewed resource use. We use the resulting expressions to fully characterize strategy interaction, strategy limitations, and the roles that these strategies play in allowing resource consumption to occur with decreasing levels of resource depletion. We also show how the derived framework may be incorporated into an economic analysis to identify least-cost approaches to depletion avoidance in a toluene production and cycling system.},

Energy and exergy analyses are conducted, and their respective efficiencies are determined for the whole systems and their components. These efficiencies are then compared for performance assessment and cleaner production. Improvement potentials for every system component and the overall system are calculated and compared. Four performance-related parameters, namely energetic renewability rate, exergetic renewability rate, system energetic reinjection rate and system exergetic reinjection rate are investigated. The analysis results show that overall system energy and exergy efficiency are increased by 3.40 and 1.12 times for cooling season and about 4.25 and 1.25 times for heating season, as compared to the single power generating option.},

abstract = {SignificanceMany case studies of specific cities have investigated factors that contribute to urban energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions. The analysis in this study is based on data from 274 cities and three global datasets and provides a typology of urban attributes of energy use. The results highlight that appropriate policies addressing urban climate change mitigation differ with type of city. A global urbanization wedge, corresponding in particular to energy-efficient urbanization in Asia, might reduce urban energy use by more than 25\%, compared with a business-as-usual scenario. The aggregate potential for urban mitigation of global climate change is insufficiently understood. Our analysis, using a dataset of 274 cities representing all city sizes and regions worldwide, demonstrates that economic activity, transport costs, geographic factors, and urban form explain 37\% of urban direct energy use and 88\% of urban transport energy use. If current trends in urban expansion continue, urban energy use will increase more than threefold, from 240 EJ in 2005 to 730 EJ in 2050. Our model shows that urban planning and transport policies can limit the future increase in urban energy use to 540 EJ in 2050 and contribute to mitigating climate change. However, effective policies for reducing urban greenhouse gas emissions differ with city type. The results show that, for affluent and mature cities, higher gasoline prices combined with compact urban form can result in savings in both residential and transport energy use. In contrast, for developing-country cities with emerging or nascent infrastructures, compact urban form, and transport planning can encourage higher population densities and subsequently avoid lock-in of high carbon emission patterns for travel. The results underscore a significant potential urbanization wedge for reducing energy use in rapidly urbanizing Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.},

@article{DAlisa2012,
abstract = {The waste crisis in Campania has inspired a vast amount of studies. Nevertheless, very little research has been done to explain the figures of waste generation and disposal in the region. The analyses carried out so far according to the indicators used by official statistics – i.e. Waste Generated, Waste Generated per capita and Separate Collection – fail to represent this hot spot case. This paper attempts to bridge this gap. Adopting the rationale of a new accounting system, the Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM), two waste indicators are proposed to complement the conventional ones: the Metabolic Rate of Waste and the Density of Waste. Then a multi-scale analysis of the Density of Waste Disposed (DWD) tests its suitability to characterise Campania’s waste patterns. The data cover the period from 1999 to 2007. The results show that the DWD complements available indicators and further helps to explain the biophysical pressure and ecological unsustainability of the waste management in the region. The multi-scale analysis shows that regional data hide a relevant territorial diversity, emergent in the provincial analysis and even more so in the municipal one. These results have implications for governance and for the debate about mono-scale versus multi-scale solutions to waste management problems. Finally, the analysis allows some analytical generalisations on the suitability of the DWD to detect situations of potential waste crisis in other study-contexts.},

abstract = {This study evaluates direct and indirect environmental impacts associated with the consumption of goods and services by the households living in the municipality of Aveiro (Portugal) using environmentally extended input output (IO) analysis. The environmental impacts addressed are greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil fuel consumption. A methodology adapted to the specificities of the data available is proposed. This methodology relies on the Portuguese economic IO table, on GHG emission and fossil fuel consumption intensities, and on national household expenditure data downscaled to the urban level. This methodology could also be applied to other municipalities or cities for which data on local household expenditures are missing. This study also identifies the sectors with the largest impacts in order to prioritise strategies for reducing the impacts to move the municipality towards more sustainable consumption. The estimated total GHG emissions in 2005 amounted to 26 kg CO2-eq./cap/day and the total fossil fuel consumption was 7.3 koe/cap/day. The sectors that contributed most for both indicators are “land transport and transport by pipelines”, “food, beverages and tobacco”, “construction” and “production, collection and distribution of electricity”. Therefore, improvement measures are proposed for these sectors in order to more effectively decrease the environmental impacts related with GHG emissions and fossil energy consumption of the municipality.},

The estimation of the context relevance of the educational process and results addresses three aspects – advanced European practice in higher education for sustainable development, educational needs in the spatial planning field, and CEE regional peculiarities. Through analysing identified contextually rooted challenges and success factors in the educational process, and relating them to the broader global and regional process, the author claims the need for a better focused and contextually sensitive support to the local efforts for integrating the SD topic into the restructuring higher education institutions in the CEE region.},

Like any analysis technique, the accuracy of the results is as good as the data available, but the additional challenge is that the data need to characterize an entire ecosystem's flows and storages. Thus, data requirements are substantial. As a result, there have, in fact, not been a significant number of network models constructed and development of the network analysis methodology has progressed largely within the purview of a few established models. In this paper, we outline the steps for one approach to construct network models. Lastly, we also provide a brief overview of the algorithmic methods used to construct food web typologies when empirical data are not available. It is our aim that such an effort aids other researchers to consider the construction of such models as well as encourages further refinement of this procedure.},

abstract = {A key factor deciding the capacity to increase the sustainability of final products is the energy efficiency. The energy embodied in a product is an aggregation of all of the energy embodied in the products' components and subsystems, expended through its manufacturing processes and logistical activities. Currently, accurate estimation of this energy metric is hindered due to the unavailability of energy use data traceable to individual processes and equipment associated with the product's assembly. In this paper, we propose using minimally-required energy to compute energy efficiency of a product assembly process. Based on the proposed approach, efficiency metrics established on the process, product, material and equipment characteristics have been presented at the assembly activity and equipment level. A case study has been presented for a hybrid laser welding process to demonstrate the computational methods used to arrive at these efficiency metrics. Major contributions of this paper are the metrics development and exemplifying the metrics through an actual assembly process (hybrid laser welding) case study. We will explain how these metrics can provide industries with a capability to identify opportunities to improve their sustainability performance across their assembly processes.},

abstract = {The ecological footprint is a measure of the resources necessary to produce the goods that an individual or population consumes. It is also used as a measure of sustainability, though evidence suggests that it falls short. The assumptions behind footprint calculations have been extensively criticized; I present here further evidence that it fails to satisfy simple economic principles because the basic assumptions are contradicted by both theory and historical data. Specifically, I argue that the footprint arbitrarily assumes both zero greenhouse gas emissions, which may not be ex ante optimal, and national boundaries, which makes extrapolating from the average ecological footprint problematic. The footprint also cannot take into account intensive production, and so comparisons to biocapacity are erroneous. Using only the assumptions of the footprint then, one could argue that the Earth can sustain greatly increased production, though there are important limitations that the footprint cannot address, such as land degradation. Finally, the lack of correlation between land degradation and the ecological footprint obscures the effects of a larger sustainability problem. Better measures of sustainability would address these issues directly.},

abstract = {Several measures of ecosystem structure and function are derived from the application of economic input-output analysis to ecosystem compartment models. Total system throughflow (TST) is defined as the sum of all compartmental throughflows. Average path length of the ith inflow (APL1) is defined as the average number of compartments through which the ith inflow passes. Average path length for an average inflow (ĀPL) is the mean of APL1 weighted according to size of the inflows. ĀPL is shown to be equal to TST divided by the sum of all inflows. TST can be partitioned into a portion due to cycled flow (TSTo) and a portion due to flow straight through the system (straight throughflow, TSTs). The portion of ĀPL due to cycled flow divided by the portion due to straight throughflow is the cycling index (CI). This index indicates how many times further than the straight throughflow path length an average system inflow will travel because of cycling. Three simple ecosystem models are examined to demonstrate the utility of these measures in explaining ecological phenomena.},

abstract = {The Economic Energy Intensity of a country, defined as the ratio between the energy consumed and the Gross Domestic Product of a country, is a widely-adopted indicator of economic performance, often applied to sustainability analysis. The usefulness of this indicator has been challenged on the basis of the fact that the two variables making up this ratio are correlated. This implies that, when considered in isolation, each one of these two variables (Energy Consumption p.c. and GDP p.c.) maps on to typologies of socio-economic systems (e.g. developed countries vs. less developed countries), however calculating their ratio produces an indicator which does not map on to any meaningful typology of economic system (a number without an external referent). This paper checks the validity of this criticism by looking at the Economic Energy Intensity (EEI) of 133 countries over the period 1960–2009. Two approaches are used for this task: (1) an analysis at a given point in time (year 2009): after excluding countries with real GDP p.c.<5000 US\$ I considered three clusters of countries with similar values of EEI. Within each cluster, when looking at similar values of EEI, we find extremely diverse typologies of economies; (2) a video showing the movement in time of 133 countries between 1960 and 2010 over the plane determined by the two variables composing the indicator. These results confirm the doubts about both the meaning and usefulness of the indicator itself. In particular this analysis indicates that the problems with the EEI indicator are generated by the attempt to compress into a single number different pieces of information referring to different dimensions (monetary and energy flows) and to different scales (the characteristics of the whole country are determined by the specific characteristics of different sectors).},

abstract = {The increasing prominence of Sustainable Development as a policy objective has initiated a debate on appropriate frameworks and tools that will both provide guidance for a shift towards sustainability as well as a measure, preferably quantitative, of that shift. Sustainability assessment has thus the challenging task of capturing, addressing and suggesting solutions for a diverse set of issues that affect stakeholders with different values and span over different spatial and temporal scales. However sustainability assessment is still not a mature framework in the sense that Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) are. This paper aims to provide suggestions for improving the sustainability evaluation part of a sustainability assessment. In particular it will provide a comprehensive review of different sustainability evaluation tools (from a reductionist perspective) as well as the feasibility of incorporating them within a sustainability assessment framework. Reviewed tools include monetary tools, biophysical models and sustainability indicators/composite indices that have been developed within different disciplines such as economics, statistics, ecology, engineering and town planning.},

Extended exergy efficiencies were somewhat different owing to the different calculation procedure. Extended exergy efficiencies were 91.4\% for the extraction sector, 38.9\% for the conversion sector, 49.1\% for the agriculture sector, 31.5\% for the transportation sector, 38.6\% for the industrial sector and 80.0\% for the tertiary sector.},

The concept of the Multi Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal Metabolism (MSIASM) is applied in order to elucidate the evolution of the UK economy for the period between 1981 and 2004. Our findings highlight the transition to a service-based economy and the disproportionate increase of energy demand when compared to the overall population increase. Emergy synthesis is applied in order to understand the production and consumption patterns and the environmental support required to sustain human activity within the UK for the year 2004. Generally speaking the UK society greatly benefits from its significant natural resources with 44.3\% of the total emergy used coming from home sources and 29.1\% from locally renewable sources. Interestingly enough, despite its significant natural resources, the UK economy, seems to be a net emergy importer by 638.5×1021seJ. Furthermore, the current economic activity is believed to have a significant impact in the environment despite the relatively low environmental load ratio of 2.44.},

abstract = {With the rapid urbanization, many cities are facing various environmental issues, resulting in local ecological degradation. It is critical to conduct a scientific assessment so that appropriate solutions can be found by considering the local realities. Many evaluation methods, such as emergy analysis, material flow analysis, data envelopment analysis and ecological footprint analysis, have been proposed. Among them, ecological footprint analysis has been applied as a useful policy and planning tool for evaluating urban sustainability. The aim of this paper is to evaluate two industrial cities by using ecological footprint method in Shenyang, China and Kawasaki, Japan. The two cities have been “friendship cities” for over 30 years and have similar industrial structures. In order to present a holistic evolution picture on their ecological footprints, we collected all the relevant data for the period of 1997–2009. The results show that Shenyang's ecological footprints experienced a significant increase, while such figures in Kawasaki were quite stable, but per capita figures in Shenyang were much less than those in Kawasaki, indicating that a gap between the two cities still exist. In order to further improve its sustainable development, Shenyang should closely collaborate with Kawasaki, learning Kawasaki's eco-town experiences and other environmental management experiences. In addition, Shenyang should also learn from other leading cities and try to optimize its industrial and energy structure and improve their citizens' environmental awareness so that it can move toward a more sustainable development direction.},

Compared to other anaerobic systems, such as UASB reactors, the membrane technology allows the use of biogas-assisted mixing which enhances the methane stripping from the liquid phase bulk. The methane saturation index obtained for the whole period (1.00±0.04) evidenced that the equilibrium condition was reached and the methane loss with the effluent was reduced. The methane recovery efficiency obtained at 20 °C (53.6\%) was slightly lower than at 33 °C (57.4\%) due to a reduction of the treatment efficiency, as evidenced by the lower methane production and the higher waste sludge per litre of treated wastewater. For both operational temperatures, the methane recovery efficiency was strongly affected by the high sulphate concentration in the influent wastewater.},

abstract = {Four experimental columns were employed in this study to investigate their performance under wastewater treatment conditions. One column was set-up as a biological aerated filter and the remaining three were set-up as microbial fuel cells (MFCs), two of which were connected to an external load whereas the third was left open circuit. The performance of the columns under several flow rates and leachate strengths was studied in terms of BOD5 removal efficiencies and electricity generation, when a fixed resistive load was connected. Results obtained demonstrated that it is possible to generate electricity and simultaneously treat landfill leachate in MFC columns. Energy generation in MFC columns improved with increasing flow rates from 24 to 192 mL/h, while BOD5 removal efficiency levels reached a maximum at 48 mL/h and dropped to relatively low values at higher flow rates. The maximum removal efficiencies were obtained at a loading rate of 0.81 kg BOD5/m3 d for columns C1, C2 and C4 and 1.81 kg BOD5/m3 d for column C3. Electrical output levels and BOD5 concentrations at the MFC columns showed a linear relationship, which allows the system to be used as a BOD5 sensor. Part of the BOD removal was not associated with power generation and was attributed to the presence of alternative end terminal electron acceptors and volatilisation. The MFC columns could reach the same or even higher removal efficiencies than those from the biological aerated filter with the advantage of producing energy and saving cost of aeration. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that compares the MFC technology with other conventional treatment systems for removing pollutants from wastewater. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Called the "Hestia Project", this research effort is the first to use bottom-up methods to quantify all fossil fuel CO(2) emissions down to the scale of individual buildings, road segments, and industrial/electricity production facilities on an hourly basis for an entire urban landscape. Here, we describe the methods used to quantify the on-site fossil fuel CO(2) emissions across the city of Indianapolis, IN. This effort combines a series of data sets and simulation tools such as a building energy simulation model, traffic data, power production reporting, and local air pollution reporting. The system is general enough to be applied to any large U.S. city and holds tremendous potential as a key component of a carbon-monitoring system in addition to enabling efficient greenhouse gas mitigation and planning. We compare the natural gas component of our fossil fuel CO(2) emissions estimate to consumption data provided by the local gas utility. At the zip code level, we achieve a bias-adjusted Pearson r correlation value of 0.92 (p < 0.001).},

abstract = {In today's world, there is a continuous global need for more energy which, at the same time, has to be cleaner than the energy produced from the traditional generation technologies. This need has facilitated the increasing penetration of distributed generation (DG) technologies and primarily of renewable energy sources (RES). The extensive use of such energy sources in today's electricity networks can indisputably minimize the threat of global warming and climate change. However, the power output of these energy sources is not as reliable and as easy to adjust to changing demand cycles as the output from the traditional power sources. This disadvantage can only be effectively overcome by the storing of the excess power produced by DG-RES. Therefore, in order for these new sources to become completely reliable as primary sources of energy, energy storage is a crucial factor. In this work, an overview of the current and future energy storage technologies used for electric power applications is carried out. Most of the technologies are in use today while others are still under intensive research and development. A comparison between the various technologies is presented in terms of the most important technological characteristics of each technology. The comparison shows that each storage technology is different in terms of its ideal network application environment and energy storage scale. This means that in order to achieve optimum results, the unique network environment and the specifications of the storage device have to be studied thoroughly, before a decision for the ideal storage technology to be selected is taken. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {AbstractNational infrastructure systems (energy, transport, digital communications, water, and waste) provide essential services to society. Although for the most part these systems developed in a piecemeal way, they are now an integrated and highly interdependent “system of systems.” However, understanding the long-term performance trajectory of national infrastructure has proved to be very difficult because of the complexity of these systems (in physical and institutional terms) and because there is little tradition of thinking cross-sectorally about infrastructure system performance. Here, a methodology is proposed for analyzing national multisectoral infrastructure systems performance in the context of uncertain futures, incorporating interdependencies in demand across sectors. Three contrasting strategies are considered for infrastructure provision (capacity intensive, capacity constrained, and decentralized) and multiattribute performance metrics are analyzed in the context of low, medium, and high ...},

abstract = {The exergy method has been used to analyse changes in the structure of the UK energy system over a period of more than 30 years from 1965. A sectoral approach was employed, with the supply side examined in terms of the main energy sources, while final demand was separated into four energy end-use groups: the domestic, service, industrial and transport sectors. Estimates of sector-weighted or 'lumped' parameters, such as exergy efficiencies, were obtained from the particular characteristics of each sector. These were employed to determine the exergetic 'improvement potential' for critical elements of the energy system. Electricity generation together with final energy demand in the domestic sector and in transport are shown to account for nearly 80 per cent of the Second Law improvement potential. This poor thermodynamic performance is principally due to exergy losses in combustion and heat transfer processes associated with power generation, space heating and main transport modes. The results of the exergy analysis are placed in the context of recent developments in energy market liberalization and of the need to achieve environmental sustainability. They are also contrasted with proposals for new or improved energy technologies to meet the requirements of a sustainable energy strategy. Finally, the role of the exergy method is contrasted with the various other approaches to energy technology assessment.},

abstract = {In the discourse about sustainable development, `constant natural capital' is frequently referred to as a criterion for ecological sustainability. But what is `natural capital'? The concept will be analyzed by presenting arguments in favour of using the term and different versions of sustainability (strong and weak). Subsequently, a critique of the `natural capital' concept is brought forward, from an ecological as well as from an economic perspective. Following this critique, the use of material inputs and the material input per unit of service (MIPS) as a measure for the environmental impact potential is suggested. Dematerialisation is understood to be an alternative management rule for sustainability. In conclusion, a change of perspective is proposed. Due to the conceptual and measurement problems associated with the `constant-natural-capital' criterion (which refers to a stock), it seems more reasonable from a scientific as well as from a practical perspective to add flows (i.e. material inputs) to a decision criterion for whether a development is sustainable or not.},

abstract = {Membrane bioreactor technology (MBR) a combination of the activated sludge process with micro- and ultrafiltration is widely regarded as an effective tool for industrial water treatment and water reuse due to its high product water quality and low footprint. Due to their robustness and flexibility submerged MBR systems are more and more preferred. This paper highlights two case studies for industrial application in a commercial laundry and in a textile factory. A large-scale integrated water reuse process based on MBR+RO technology (capacity 200 m3/d) has been designed and established in a German laundry within an EC funded project eventually resulting in a reuse ratio of around 80\% of the total wastewater. The process was in full operation at the beginning of 2007 and has been operated economically since that time without any failure. Within another EC funded project a small-scale MBR (capacity up to 0.4 m3/d) has been successfully tested in a Chinese textile factory. Despite high concentration of low biodegradable chemical in the wastewater, the COD removal rate achieved around 90\%. However, the MBR permeate quality was not as high as in the laundry due to remaining colored dyestuff what makes an additional treatment step such as nanofiltration or reverse osmosis necessary in order to increase the proportion of reused water. In order to improve rejection of low molecular weight organics Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences and the Institute of Membrane Technology have started a new EC funded project within a consortium of 11 partners in total which aims at developing novel membrane materials providing a basis for the development of a NF MBR reactor.},

abstract = {The application of anaerobic co-digestion of food waste with sewage sludge, although well established in many European countries, is still in its infancy in the UK. This process has many benefits to offer, with a successful application often associated with increased renewable energy potential, outweighing constraints associated with the variability of food waste and its handling requirements prior to co-digestion. With both regulations and water infrastructures designed and constructed on the basis of linear views and sectorial requirements and conditions and technologies from the past in many parts of the world, in the UK, sewage sludge and food waste digestion operations are also under very different regulatory and management regimes. With sustainability requiring that we do not address single issues in isolation, but through a systems approach that delivers integrated solutions, co-digestion of food waste with sewage sludge could become such a solution. If carefully applied, co-digestion can deliver beneficial synergies for the water industry and authorities responsible for food waste management. The collaboration of all relevant stakeholders and regulators to support changes to current regulatory frameworks to enable this, is proposed as the way forward, particularly as their complexity has been identified as the major hurdle to the implementation of co-digestion in the UK.},

abstract = {Recycling contributes significantly to the natural resources preservation. However since recycling technology at the same time requires primary materials and energy input, both contributing to the natural resources depletion, it is important to evaluate the resource efficiency of the whole recycling chain to determine the actual benefit of recycling. For such an evaluation exergy analysis can be used by calculation of the exergy efficiency as an indicator for the resource efficiency of the recycling chain. In this paper exergy analysis is added as a metric to the fundamental recycling system optimisation model developed previously by the authors. This addition allows evaluation and optimisation of the recycling system environmental performance on a fundamental basis, capturing exergy efficiency in the system as a function of physical, metallurgical and thermal processing and the quality of recyclates. Several car recycling scenarios have been evaluated using the fundamental recycling system optimisation model. The results reveal the influence of legislatively required recycling/recovery quotas and recycling system architecture on the environmental benefits of recycling. The results suggest that legislation does not represent the best exergy and resource efficiency of the system supporting the view that the present stringent legislation for end-of-life vehicle recycling is violating fundamental thermodynamics.},

abstract = {Cities are complex systems of accumulated matter. The continuous process of matter accumulation in urban systems differs in intensity across the globe according to specific urban features, such as location and age of the urban tissue, and as a physical manifestation of metabolic lineaments, material accumulation should differ amongst cities. In this paper, a new indicator to measure this process of material accumulation is proposed, namely, the Technomass. Emulating ecology, which measures biomass in natural ecosystems, a sample of different urban tissues in a given city – Bogot\'{a} – was measured in terms of volume and rates of matter accumulation. Technomass is able to indicate overall asymptotic behaviour, specific spatial profiles and intensification of rates in time. In metabolic terms, the indicator looks into the black box, providing the possibility to link metabolic behaviours with urban form and attempting to fill the gap between urban planning, urban metabolism (UM) and Material Flow Analysis (MFA). This new indicator offers a broad scope of applications. Further possibilities and links to urban research and policy making are explored in the discussion section.},

abstract = {The Economic Order Quantity, EOQ, model has been popular among academicians and practitioners for decades. Despite the many variants of the EOQ that have appeared in the literature to fine-tune it to reality, it still has limitations. A major one is that it does not take into account the hidden costs inherent in inventory systems. Some of these costs relate to sustainability issues including environmental, social labor, and economic effects. This paper considers some of these costs, referred to as the exergetic costs, and estimates them using the Extended Exergy Accounting, EEA, approach. Extended Exergy Accounting assigns equivalent exergetic values to capital, labor and environmental remediation costs of a system. The analysis combines the classical exergy analysis with the sustainability factors, which are the labor, capital and environment. The paper uses an exergetic model to determine the EOQ inventory policies for three firms operating in the USA, Germany and China. The results show that the EOQ is different for the three firms because the equivalent exergy of capital, labor and environment remediation costs is different in each country.},

abstract = {This paper presented a thermodynamic synthesis that involved resource accounting, evaluation and modeling of urban ecosystems based on embodied cosmic exergy (EcE), which redefined embodied exergy with the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) as the reference for solar exergy. In a case study of the Beijing urban ecosystem, the major resources supporting the urban ecosystem, both from free natural resources and from the economy, were accounted for, analyzed and evaluated in the same units, Cosmic Joules (Jc). These indicators revealed the current performance of the Beijing urban ecosystem by considering five aspects of the system: EcE sources, EcE intensity, EcE welfare, environmental impacts and economic efficiency. Moreover, through the combination of the EcE synthesis with a systems dynamics, this research constructed an embodied cosmic exergy-based urban system model (EESM) using Beijing as an example of urban development. The results show that the 10 years from 2010 to 2020 will be very critical for the sustainable development of Beijing because many key factors, such as water resources, wastes and urban assets, might be confronted with great changes during this period. These changes will inevitably transform the urban system not only in its external circumstances but also in its inner structure and may lead to serious consequences. Of all the necessary resources, the most sensitive factor is water supply.},

abstract = {An integrated ecological evaluation of the Beijing economy was presented in the paper based on the emergy accounting with the data in 2004. Through calculating environmental and economic inputs within and outside the Beijing economy, this paper discusses the Beijing’s resource structure, economic situation and trade status based on a series of emergy indicators. Through the comparison of the systematic indicators of Beijing with those of the selected Chinese cities, the general status of the Beijing economy in China is identified. The results also show that most indicators of Beijing are located at middle levels among the selected Chinese cities. Particularly, the environmental impacts, expressed by the ratio of waste to the renewable emergy, and the ratio of waste to the total emergy use, are 84.2 and 0.26, respectively in Beijing in 2004, which indicate that the Beijing economy is greatly reliant on the imported intensive fuels, goods and services with high empower density and environmental loading.},

abstract = {Hitherto, applied calculations of exergy for higher organisms have been based on traditional thermodynamic considerations, which did not take into account the organizational level of organisms. It seems reasonable to include such perspectives in a thermodynamic evaluation of ecosystems. Therefore, two methods that are theoretically more sound for calculations of exergy for higher organisms are proposed in this paper. The first is based upon the thermodynamic information due to genes. The method is rooted in statistical thermodynamics and should be considered the best candidate for exergy calculations of ecosystems including higher organisms. The second method is a parallel to the method used for calculation of emergy, and is based on the cost of free energy computed from an ecological network. Because this method does not consider the increase of information due to evolution, it should be considered theoretically less sound than the first mentioned method. It is, however, interesting to compare the two methods, as they to a certain extent reflect the differences between emergy and exergy. Emergy attempts, as exergy, to account for the quality of energy by the use of a transformity factor. The transformity factors for calculation of emergy are found from the network as the number of solar equivalents that it has cost to construct the considered organism. Emergy is therefore often more easy to compute, provided that the ecological network is known, while exergy after the new methods for calculations presented here seems to have a better theoretical basis. The two methods tested for calculation of exergy give different results, but the results are in the same order of magnitude. The two major problems in development of ecological models are the parameter estimation and the selection of the best model structure. The latter requires that more ecological system properties are incorporated in our models. A procedure based upon recent developments in ecosystem theory is proposed to meet this requirement. It should be considered a first approach to a theoretical improvement of the modelling procedure for development of models with more ecological properties.},

abstract = {Bridging the gap between concepts derived from Second Law of Thermodynamics and their application to Engineering practice, the property exergy and the exergy balance can be a tool for analyzing and improving the performance of energy conversion processes. With the exergy analysis it is possible to evaluate the performance of energy conversion processes not only on a thermodynamics basis but also by including production costs and environmental aspects and impacts of the studied processes. This comprehensive approach of the use of energy has, as one of the most important feature, the identification of sustainable ways of energy resources utilization.  Based on the fundamentals of the exergy concept, its calculation, graphical representations and exergy balances evaluation, Exergy: Production Cost And Renewability describes the application of detailed exergy and thermoeconomic analysis to power plants and polygeneration systems, petroleum production and refining plants (including hydrogen production), chemical plants, biofuel production routes, combined production of ethanol and electricity, aircraft systems design, environmental impact mitigation processes and human body behavior.  The presented case studies aim at providing students, researchers and engineers with guidelines to the utilization of the exergy and thermoeconomic analysis to model, simulate and optimize real processes and industrial plants.},

abstract = {This study asks what is the ‘best’ way to measure urban energy efficiency. There has been recent interest in identifying efficient cities so that best practices can be shared, a process known as benchmarking. Previous studies have used relatively simple metrics that provide limited insight on the complexity of urban energy efficiency and arguably fail to provide a ‘fair’ measure of urban performance. Using a data set of 198 urban UK local administrative units, three methods are compared: ratio measures, regression residuals, and data envelopment analysis. The results show that each method has its own strengths and weaknesses regarding the ease of interpretation, ability to identify outliers and provide consistent rankings. Efficient areas are diverse but are notably found in low income areas of large conurbations such as London, whereas industrial areas are consistently ranked as inefficient. The results highlight the shortcomings of the underlying production-based energy accounts. Ideally urban energy efficiency benchmarks would be built on consumption-based accounts, but interim recommendations are made regarding the use of efficiency measures that improve upon current practice and facilitate wider conversations about what it means for a specific city to be energy-efficient within an interconnected economy.},

abstract = {The paper reports on a prototype urban metabolism approach to model carbon cycling through an urban neighborhood. The approach uses bottom-up modeling of urban form components (buildings, vehicles, people, plants) to assess the neighborhood-wide storage, intake and export (including atmospheric emissions) of carbon. Model inputs (land cover, population, building types, vegetation structure) were derived through integration of spatial and non-spatial data from remote sensing, statistical and cadastral sources. Results are quantified and illustrated as whole system and component carbon flows attributable to (i) buildings, (ii) transportation, (iii) humans (including food and waste), and (iv) vegetation and soils sectors. Three emissions reduction scenarios use these results as a baseline against which to illustrate the potential of familiar climate change planning strategies. These scenarios achieve per capita emission reductions targets of approximately 37\%, 52\% and 69\% from that baseline. Concluding discussion considers the limits, replicability and potential of the approach for linking climate change to local planning.},

abstract = {The continuous increase in the level of greenhouse gas emissions and the climb in fuel prices are the main driving forces behind efforts to more effectively utilise various sources of renewable energy. In many parts of the world, direct solar radiation is considered to be one of the most prospective sources of energy. However, the large-scale utilisation of this form of energy is possible only if the effective technology for its storage can be developed with acceptable capital and running costs. One of prospective techniques of storing solar energy is the application of phase change materials (PCMs). Unfortunately, prior to the large-scale practical application of this technology, it is necessary to resolve numerous problems at the research and development stage. This paper looks at the current state of research in this particular field, with the main focus being on the assessment of the thermal properties of various PCMs, methods of heat transfer enhancement and design configurations of heat storage facilities to be used as a part of solar passive and active space heating systems, greenhouses and solar cooking.},

The review finds that there are two related, non-conflicting, schools of urban metabolism: one following Odum describes metabolism in terms of energy equivalents; while the second more broadly expresses a city's flows of water, materials and nutrients in terms of mass fluxes. Four example applications of urban metabolism studies are discussed: urban sustainability indicators; inputs to urban greenhouse gas emissions calculation; mathematical models of urban metabolism for policy analysis; and as a basis for sustainable urban design. Future directions include fuller integration of social, health and economic indicators into the urban metabolism framework, while tackling the great sustainability challenge of reconstructing cities.},

In addition, it addresses the role of utilities in the provision of services and regulatory actions that, along with public governance, may influence (and/or control) the urban metabolism. In the article, we give background context to the growth and development of megacities, their overarching socio-economic issues, and the definition of their boundaries. Two methodologies to define megacity boundaries are compared, showing that the definition of ‘megacity’ is not trivial and that further investigation is needed to establish a baseline for comparison of urban metabolism data. Use of the standardized indicator set will ease inter-city comparisons of urban metabolism, whilst enhancing knowledge of megacities and their transformation into sustainable systems.},

abstract = {This paper describes the methodology and data used to determine greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions attributable to ten cities or city-regions: Los Angeles County, Denver City and County, Greater Toronto, New York City, Greater London, Geneva Canton, Greater Prague, Barcelona, Cape Town and Bangkok. Equations for determining emissions are developed for contributions from: electricity; heating and industrial fuels; ground transportation fuels; air and marine fuels; industrial processes; and waste. Gasoline consumption is estimated using three approaches: from local fuel sales; by scaling from regional fuel sales; and from counts of vehicle kilometres travelled. A simplified version of an intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) method for estimating the GHG emissions from landfill waste is applied. Three measures of overall emissions are suggested: (i) actual emissions within the boundary of the city; (ii) single process emissions (from a life-cycle perspective) associated with the city's metabolism; and (iii) life-cycle emissions associated with the city's metabolism. The results and analysis of the study will be published in a second paper.},

abstract = {We are presenting material flow accounting and related indicators for an Indian adivasis village in 1983 (Sarowar, Dangs, Gujarat). It gives a point of comparison with modern nation-wide material flow accounting. The aim is to test the feasibility of indicators of dematerialization of the economy in poor economies. We measured the annual material flows within the Sarowar village (670 inhabitants) in 1982–1983. The method was a combination of surveys, real time measurements, indirect measurements and laboratory dry matter measurements. The results were translated into recent concepts of material flow accounting (MFA), and compared with nation-wide studies. The total material requirement (TMR) of Sarowar (excluding air and water), USA, Japan, Germany and The Netherlands is respectively about 5, 84, 46, 86 and 84 tons per capita per year. The input (all biotic materials are expressed in tons dry matter) totalised 15.8 t DM cap−1 y−1 in Sarowar, which consists mainly of air (11 t cap−1 y−1) and biotic primary materials (4.1 t DM cap−1 y−1). The latest was composed of 29\% of pastures, 25\% of branches for field burning, 35\% of fuel wood, 6\% fodder, 1\% of construction wood and 4\% of grains. The outputs (15.8 t cap−1 y−1) were dominated by CO2 (15.1 t cap−1 y−1). In contrast, the output of The Netherlands (66.8 t cap−1 y−1) is dominated by export with air emissions (19 t cap−1 y−1), export (16 t cap−1 y−1) and embedded export (29 t cap−1 y−1). The apparent eco-efficiency (kg per US dollar, excluding air and water, including hidden flows) is 70, 3, 3, 3 and 3 kg \$−1 respectively for Sarowar, Japan, USA, Germany and The Netherlands. The corrected eco-efficiency using Purchasing Power Parity is less contrasted with respectively 18, 3, 3, 4 and 3 kg \$−1. Traditional human ecosystem measurements can serve as a basic comparison point, and as a test for dematerialization indicators. The limit of the indicator of eco-efficiency resides in the different degrees of monetization of the economies. In less monetized economies, this indicator is highly biased by the underlying non-market material flows. We discuss the use of ratios of non-substitutable factors in dematerialization assessment and we suggest the use of multi-criteria analysis instead.},

abstract = {After a brief historical introduction, this paper proceeds to derive expressions for the available work of a thermodynamic system while the latter interacts with the passive environment. The passive environment is modelled as a union of three idealized reservoirs — energy, volume, and matter. The available work is defined as the optimum amount — largest or smallest — exchanged in circumstances given a prescribed initial and final state of the system. Two types of systems are studied — closed systems and open flow systems — and the interaction is progressively enlarged to include the transfer of heat, the transfer of work, and the transfer of matter. Available work is the difference between the exergy of states 1 and 2; the exergy of a state being defined as the optimum work achieveable against a final state which is one of equilibrium with the surroundings. It is shown that exergy so defined is not a unique quantity for a given system and state, because it also depends on the kind of interaction permitted and therefore on the kind of equilibrium achieved. Exergy, and not energy, is found to represent the preferred measure of a system's “capacity to perform work”. Remarks are made about the contemporary terminology of this field, and regrets are expressed concerning the present day proliferation of terms.},

abstract = {Nation-level Ecological Footprint accounts are currently produced for more than 150 nations, with multiple calculations available for some nations. The data sets that result from these national assessments typically serve as the basis for Footprint calculations at smaller scales, including those for regions, cities, businesses, and individuals. Global Footprint Network's National Footprint Accounts, supported and used by more than 70 major organizations worldwide, contain the most widely used national accounting methodology today. The National Footprint Accounts calculations are undergoing continuous improvement as better data becomes available and new methodologies are developed. In this paper, a community of active Ecological Footprint practitioners and users propose key research priorities for improving national Ecological Footprint accounting. For each of the proposed improvements, we briefly review relevant literature, summarize the current state of debate, and suggest approaches for further development. The research agenda will serve as a reference for a large scale, international research program devoted to furthering the development of national Ecological Footprint accounting methodology.},

abstract = {Reduction of costs incurred for supplying water and heating it for household purposes is possible by means of an application of systems recovering heat from drain water in combination with water flow limiters. Then, not only advantageous financial results can be obtained, but also positive effects in the form of reduced use of fossil fuels, improved air quality, and limited water consumption. This paper presents a calculation model that allows to assess the synergy of financial effects for different variants of an investment project consisting in mounting a water flow limiter and a DWHR unit in a shower system of a single-family building. This model has a large application potential that can be used as a tool facilitating the decision-making process both in the system design and modernization stage. A simulation test carried out for the case study involving different variants of modernization of a household shower system shows that profitability of such investment depends on the adopted modernization variant and system usage parameters. The best financial performance characterizes variants involving the use of a water flow limiter or both devices. The mounting of both devices becomes the most advantageous when the shower taking time is long. The obtained results additionally show that the most favorable financial effects can be achieved in buildings in which the total time of using shower facilities is the longest. The application of the presented solutions will be, therefore, particularly profitable in case of buildings characterized with significant water consumption and high rotation of users.},

The housing sector has a big environmental impact and it makes a good candidate for changes to be implemented in order to make steps towards a sustainable society. This study deals with the exergy analysis and the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of solar systems for space heating, cooling and hot domestic water production. These systems will be applied to a residence in the wide Thessaloniki area, in Northern Greece. The analysis is based on the given energy needs of an average house. Furthermore, a photovoltaic system (PV) will be used for electricity production. Besides Solar energy, the existing geothermal field will be utilized via heat pumps. The system is designed to exploit solar and geothermal energy and an exergy analysis of the different elements of the system is performed so that improvements can be achieved in its efficiency and its cost be reduced. It has been shown that the exergy efficiency of the solar systems and the geothermal system are relatively low. Since almost all of the environmental impacts of the renewable energies are connected to the manufacturing of the devises for their utilization, the environmental impacts will be analyzed only at the manufacturing stage. The use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) will be used. It has been shown that the use of solar cooling has the highest environmental impact. This analysis applies for all regions since the energy needs could be adjusted and the solar radiation of that region taken into consideration.},

Nevertheless there are also many environmental impacts; thus it is crucial that transportation planning is carried out in a sustainable manner meeting optimum travel needs, promote economic prosperity and environmental preservation. In assessing the efficiency of transportation, exergy analysis is an effective tool. This work presents an energy and exergy utilization assessment for the transportation sector of Greece taking into account the sectoral energy and exergy flows for the period over 1980–2003. Energy and exergy analyses are conducted for the four subsectors of the Greek transport sector, namely highways, railways, marine and civil aviation. The road subsector appears to be the most efficient in comparison to the other subsectors for the years between 1980 and 2003. It is believed that the exergy analysis presented here provides insights into the transport energy use and could assist in the planning of an efficient transport system.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to perform a well-to-pump life cycle assessment (LCA) to investigate the overall net energy balance and environmental impact of bioethanol production using Tall Fescue grass straw as feedstock. The energy requirements and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were compared to those of gasoline to explore the potential of bioethanol as sustainable fuel. The functional unit used in the study was 10,000 MJ of energy. The data for grass seed production were collected from the farmers in Oregon and published reports. The compositions of straw, pretreatment, and hydrolysis yields were obtained from laboratory experiments. Process models were developed for ethanol production using different pretreatment technologies in SuperPro Designer to calculate the process energy, raw materials, utility use, and emissions related. The Greenhouse Gases Regulated Emissions and Energy use in Transportation model and other literature studies were used to obtain additional data. Systematic boundary identification was performed using relative mass, energy, and economic value method using a 5\% cutoff value. Ethanol yields from grass straw were estimated 256.62, 255.8, 255.3, and 230.2 L/dry metric ton of biomass using dilute acid, dilute alkali, hot water, and steam explosion pretreatments, respectively. Fossil energy required to produce one functional unit was in the range of -1507 to 3940 MJ for different ethanol production techniques. GHG emissions from ethanol LCA models were in the range of -131 to -555.4 kg CO2 eq. per 10,000 MJ of ethanol. Fossil energy use and GHG emissions during ethanol production were found to be lowest for steam explosion pretreatment among all pretreatment processes evaluated. Change in coproduct allocation from economic to mass basis during agricultural production resulted in 62.4\% and 133.1\% increase in fossil energy use and GHG emissions respectively. Technologies used for ethanol production process had major impact on total fossil energy use and GHG emissions. N2O emissions from the nitrogen fertilizers were major contributor (77\%) of total GHG emissions produced during agricultural activities. There was 57.43-112.67\% reduction in fossil energy use to produce 10,000 MJ of ethanol compared to gasoline; however, about 0.35 ha of land is also required to produce this energy.},

abstract = {Municipal water recycling processes are potential human and environmental exposure routes for low concentrations of persistent antibiotics. While the implications of such exposure scenarios are unknown, concerns have been raised regarding the possibility that continuous discharge of antibiotics to the environment may facilitate the development or proliferation of resistant strains of bacteria. As potable and non-potable water recycling schemes are continuously developed, it is imperative to improve our understanding of the fate of antibiotics during conventional and advanced wastewater treatment processes leading to high-quality water reclamation. This review collates existing knowledge with the aim of providing new insight to the influence of a wide range of treatment processes to the ultimate fate of antibiotics during conventional and advanced wastewater treatment. Although conventional biological wastewater treatment processes are effective for the removal of some antibiotics, many have been reported to occur at 10-1000 ng L-1 concentrations in secondary treated effluents. These include $\beta$-lactams, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and tetracyclines. Tertiary and advanced treatment processes may be required to fully manage environmental and human exposure to these contaminants in water recycling schemes. The effectiveness of a range of processes including tertiary media filtration, ozonation, chlorination, UV irradiation, activated carbon adsorption, and NF/RO filtration has been reviewed and, where possible, semi-quantitative estimations of antibiotics removals have been provided. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The industrial revolution and the exploitation of fossil fuels fostered profound changes on transportation systems and infrastructure enabling unprecedented urban growth. Urban regions, which now host the majority of the world's population, resemble a linear metabolism: importing most of their raw materials, food, and energy, and using these resources in an inefficient manner resulting in waste outflows. Regarding energy flows, cities are highly depending on fossil fuels and the rate at which fossil fuels are consumed is faster than their generation rate. Therefore, a shift is needed toward more sustainable energy sources. We propose a sustainable urban energy planning approach, based on the thermodynamic principle, exergy. This approach integrates multi-functionality, interaction between urban functions, and harvesting of local renewable and residual resources – Urban Harvest Approach. Synergies between urban functions are crucial to reach productive and sustainable urban regions. Resource exchange among different urban functions offers possibilities toward productive urban regions aiming for closed cycle resources management, e.g. integrating industrial ecosystems in urban ecosystems. Our method consists of six steps: (i) land-use inventory; (ii) energy demand inventory; (iii) local renewable/residual energy potential analysis; (iv) clusters of spatial functions exploration; (v) energetic linkages analysis; (vi) network patterns exploration. We tested the method at neighborhood scale, Kerkrade-West, The Netherlands. Results showed that linking spatial clusters is crucial toward circular urban metabolism. Spatial design should promote mixed land-use. The case showed that spatial planning based on urban energy harvesting is a useful method to translate generic goals to local spatial interventions. Urban energy harvesting can contribute to increased productivity, resulting in increased sustainability of urban areas, e.g. social, environmental benefits.},

abstract = {Macao is a tourist city with a dense population and has a shortage of natural resources. Almost all of the city's life-support systems thus depend on imports of external resources. During the past 20 years, Macao has experienced an economic boom accompanied by rapid social development, in which the gambling industry and related tourism services have become the main economic activity. This paper employs emergy flow analysis to investigate and characterize the evolution and development of Macao from 1983 to 2003. In addition, Macao has experienced six periods of land reclamation since 1866, supported by large-scale importation of sand and rocks from China. By simulating the emergy trends using the STELLA dynamic modeling software, we predicted the evolution of Macao's development and trends in the coming 20 years. In 2025, the city's economy is estimated to be 15 times its current size as a result of Macao's territorial expansion. The exported emergy will increase slowly and then stabilize, the population will reach 593185, and the area covered by Macao will expand to 38.91km2.},

Due to the urban activities cause impacts not only on local level but also a broader scale, Hybrid Emergy-LCA (HEML), a combining approach of Emergy Analysis (EMA) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is structured to quantitatively investigate the mechanism. For the similarity across many emerging cities in China, a large-scale sub-urban residential area named Tian Tongyuan (TTY) in Beijing was chosen for testing the HEML. Objective indicators of live quality and negative impacts are both considered. Analysis indicates that the household Emergy input of TTY is 1.76E+16sej/yr, while the prominent environmental impact is induced by Photochemical Oxidant Creation Potentials (POCP), 4.58E+05gethaneeq./yr. The sustainable performance constructed by its live quality and environmental impacts of TTY is found as 98.80\% as that of Beijing average. Mitigation polices on the building sector should be proposed because of its dominating impacts among various consuming ends of energy and materials.},

The literature review shows that all types of grey water have good biodegradability. The bathroom and the laundry grey water are deficient in both nitrogen and phosphors. The kitchen grey water has a balanced COD: N: P ratio. The review also reveals that physical processes alone are not sufficient to guarantee an adequate reduction of the organics, nutrients and surfactants. The chemical processes can efficiently remove the suspended solids, organic materials and surfactants in the low strength grey water. The combination of aerobic biological process with physical filtration and disinfection is considered to be the most economical and feasible solution for grey water recycling.

In the ITMILP, both two-stage stochastic programming and interval linear programming are introduced into a general mixed integer linear programming framework. Uncertainties expressed as not only probability density functions but also discrete intervals can be reflected. The model can help tackle the dynamic, interactive and uncertain characteristics of the solid waste management system in the City, and can address issues concerning plans for cost-effective waste diversion and landfill prolongation. Three scenarios are considered based on different waste management policies. The results indicate that reasonable solutions have been generated. They are valuable for supporting the adjustment or justification of the existing waste flow allocation patterns, the long-term capacity planning of the City's waste management system, and the formulation of local policies and regulations regarding waste generation and management.},

The objective of this study is to develop a mathematical model to integrate and optimize urban water infrastructures for supply-side planning and policy: freshwater resources and treated wastewater are allocated to various water demand categories in order to reduce contaminants in the influents supplied for drinking water, and to reduce consumption of the water resources imported from the regions beyond a city boundary. A case study is performed to validate the proposed model. An optimal urban water system of a metropolitan city is calculated on the basis of the model and compared to the existing water system. The integration and optimization decrease (i) average concentrations of the influents supplied for drinking water, which can improve human health and hygiene; (ii) total consumption of water resources, as well as electricity, reducing overall environmental impacts; (iii) life cycle cost; and (iv) water resource dependency on other regions, improving regional water security.

The operational costs can be totally offset by the benefits from biogas recovery.

Based on the account of the extended exergy utilization in the sector of urban socio-economic system, which is considered as the composition of extraction (Ex), conversion (Co), agriculture (Ag), industry (In), transportation (Tr), tertiary (Te) and households (Do) sectors, an urban ecological network model is constructed to gain insights into the economic processes oriented to sustainable urban development. Taking Beijing city as the case, the network accounting and related ecological evaluation of a practical urban economy are carried out in this study in the light of flux, efficiency, utility and structure analysis. The results showed that a large quantity of energy and resources have to be consumed to maintain the structure and function of a city. The thermodynamic efficiencies of individual sector in Beijing remain at a low level. The social system in Beijing is a highly competitive network, and there are 8 competitive relations and only two mutualistic ones. The Domestic and Agricultural sector are the major controlling factors of the system. Moreover, the assessment results of Beijing are compared with the other three socio-economic systems, Norway, UK and Italy, and the ecological network function and structure comparisons are correspondingly illuminated and discussed. The conclusions indicate that the exergy-based network analysis can be refined to become an integrative tool for evaluation, policy-making and regulation for urban socio-economic system management concerning structure and efficiency at urban levels.},

abstract = {Many different photovoltaic technologies are being developed for large-scale solar energy conversion. The wafer-based first-generation photovoltaic devices have been followed by thin-film solid semiconductor absorber layers sandwiched between two charge-selective contacts and nanostructured (or mesostructured) solar cells that rely on a distributed heterojunction to generate charge and to transport positive and negative charges in spatially separated phases. Although many materials have been used in nanostructured devices, the goal of attaining high-efficiency thin-film solar cells in such a way has yet to be achieved. Organometal halide perovskites have recently emerged as a promising material for high-efficiency nanostructured devices. Here we show that nanostructuring is not necessary to achieve high efficiencies with this material: a simple planar heterojunction solar cell incorporating vapour-deposited perovskite as the absorbing layer can have solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies of over 15 per cent (as measured under simulated full sunlight). This demonstrates that perovskite absorbers can function at the highest efficiencies in simplified device architectures, without the need for complex nanostructures.},

The highest energy yield reached 14.0 kJ/g-VS at the food waste proportion of 85\%, with hydrogen and methane yields of 106.4 ml-H2/g-VS and 353.5 ml-CH4/g-VS respectively. The dominant VFA composition was butyrate for co-digestion and sole food waste fermentation, whereas acetate was dominate in VFA for sole waste activated sludge fermentation. The VS removal efficiencies of co-digestion were 10-77\% higher than that of waste activated sludge fermentation. Only 0.1-3.2\% of the COD in feedstock was converted into hydrogen, and 14.1-40.9\% to methane, with the highest value of 40.9\% in methane achieved at food waste proportion of 85\%.},

abstract = {Municipal solid waste (MSW) should be properly disposed in order to help protect environmental quality and human health, as well as to preserve natural resources. During MSW disposal processes, a large amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) is emitted, leading to a significant impact on climate change. In this study, an inexact dynamic optimization model (IDOM) is developed for MSW-management systems under uncertainty. It grounds upon conventional mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approaches, and integrates GHG components into the modeling framework. Compared with the existing models, IDOM can not only deal with the complex tradeoff between system cost minimization and GHG-emission mitigation, but also provide optimal allocation strategies under various emission-control standards. A case study is then provided for demonstrating applicability of the developed model. The results indicate that desired waste-flow patterns with a minimized system cost and GHG-emission amount can be obtained. Of more importance, the IDOM solution is associated with over 5.5 million tonnes of TEC reduction, which is of significant economic implication for real implementations. Therefore, the proposed model could be regarded as a useful tool for realizing comprehensive MSW management with regard to mitigating climate-change impacts.},

Reduction of the production cost is very much important. Therefore, many studies on the efficient use of energy were carried out in the past. Moreover, these studies, which are based on exergy analysis, focus on industrial applications only. This paper reviewed exergy analysis, exergy balance, and exergetic efficiencies for cement industry. It is found that the exergy efficiency for cement production units ranges from 18\% to 49\% as well as the exergy losses due to the irreversibility from kiln are higher than other units in cement production plant.},

@article{Mankins2009,
abstract = {The development of new system capabilities typically depends upon the prior success of advanced technology research and development efforts. These systems developments inevitably face the three major challenges of any project: performance, schedule and budget. Done well, advanced technology programs can substantially reduce the uncertainty in all three of these dimensions of project management. Done poorly, or not at all, and new system developments suffer from cost overruns, schedule delays and the steady erosion of initial performance objectives. It is often critical for senior management to be able to determine which of these two paths is more likely—and to respond accordingly. The challenge for system and technology managers is to be able to make clear, well-documented assessments of technology readiness and risks, and to do so at key points in the life cycle of the program. In the mid 1970s, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) introduced the concept of “technology readiness levels” (TRLs) as a discipline-independent, programmatic figure of merit (FOM) to allow more effective assessment of, and communication regarding the maturity of new technologies. In 1995, the TRL scale was further strengthened by the articulation of the first definitions of each level, along with examples (J. Mankins, Technology readiness levels, A White Paper, NASA, Washington, DC, 1995. [1]). Since then, TRLs have been embraced by the U.S. Congress’ General Accountability Office (GAO), adopted by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), and are being considered for use by numerous other organizations. Overall, the TRLs have proved to be highly effective in communicating the status of new technologies among sometimes diverse organizations. This paper will review the concept of “technology readiness assessments”, and provide a retrospective on the history of “TRLs” during the past 30 years. The paper will conclude with observations concerning prospective future directions for the important discipline of technology readiness assessments.},

abstract = {Exergy analysis (EA) has demonstrated to be useful in the assessment of the energy performance of technologies, including those regarding water management. In this paper, an EA-based index like the unit exergy cost (UEC) of different water-related technologies were obtained, from transport (pumping) to depuration and even brackish and seawater desalination. Those coefficients are important to quantify the additional energy consumption of present technologies with respect to the ideal ones, which correspond to the behaviour of a reversible process. Minimum UEC values were obtained in pumping techniques (1.5). Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) ranged from 4 to 5, and commercial desalination varied from 5 (reverse osmosis) to 21 (multi-stage flash distillation). This affirms the fact that chemical-based water treatments are less efficient from the point of view of thermodynamics, however further improvements might be reached in those processes. Besides their embedded energy-efficiency information, the UEC values could be applied to assess water costs. For instance, the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) considers that environmental costs (those to restore water bodies up to an objective state) have also to be charged to water users. Consequently, the UEC values of water technologies together with energy prices could easily be used to estimate those environmental costs associated to physico-chemical degradation of water bodies.

abstract = {Sustainability is rapidly moving from an abstract concept to a measurable state of dynamic human-ecological systems. The large number of economic, social, and environmental indicators currently available provides an unwieldy view of system sustainability. To aid policy decisions, these indicators are therefore either presented in the context of a conceptual framework, or quantitatively aggregated into indices. Due to the quantitative nature of sustainability indices, their results may be given more weight by scientists and policy-makers. However, policy decisions can be ineffective or even counterproductive if they do not consider factors which influence index behavior: the scale of the available data and choice of system boundaries; the inclusion, transformation, and weighting of indicator data; and the aggregation method used. As previous reviews have demonstrated, sustainability indices do not rank countries consistently, even when using some of the same indicator data. Several improvements would increase the utility of sustainability indices for policy decisions, particularly the identification of biases introduced by the index methodology and data inclusion. The discrepancy of current sustainability indices due to theoretical or methodological differences supports the use of several complementary indices.},

abstract = {Nearly 3 billion additional urban dwellers are forecasted by 2050, an unprecedented wave of urban growth. While cities struggle to provide water to these new residents, they will also face equally unprecedented hydrologic changes due to global climate change. Here we use a detailed hydrologic model, demographic projections, and climate change scenarios to estimate per-capita water availability for major cities in the developing world, where urban growth is the fastest. We estimate the amount of water physically available near cities and do not account for problems with adequate water delivery or quality. Modeled results show that currently 150 million people live in cities with perennial water shortage, defined as having less than 100 L per person per day of sustainable surface and groundwater flow within their urban extent. By 2050, demographic growth will increase this figure to almost 1 billion people. Climate change will cause water shortage for an additional 100 million urbanites. Freshwater ecosystems in river basins with large populations of urbanites with insufficient water will likely experience flows insufficient to maintain ecological process. Freshwater fish populations will likely be impacted, an issue of special importance in regions such as India's Western Ghats, where there is both rapid urbanization and high levels of fish endemism. Cities in certain regions will struggle to find enough water for the needs of their residents and will need significant investment if they are to secure adequate water supplies and safeguard functioning freshwater ecosystems for future generations.},

We conducted the first global survey of the large cities’ water sources, and show that previous global hydrologic models that ignored urban water infrastructure significantly overestimated urban water stress. Large cities obtain 78±3\% of their water from surface sources, some of which are far away: cumulatively, large cities moved 504 billion liters a day (184km3yr−1) a distance of 27,000±3800km, and the upstream contributing area of urban water sources is 41\% of the global land surface. Despite this infrastructure, one in four cities, containing \$4.8±0.7 trillion in economic activity, remain water stressed due to geographical and financial limitations. The strategic management of these cities’ water sources is therefore important for the future of the global economy.},

abstract = {Virtual water as the overall water consumption of a building includes not only the on-site water use for constructing and operating, but also the off-site water used to supply the necessary manpower, material and equipment inputs required by the building. This paper advances a systematic virtual water accounting framework for building by employing a hybrid method as the combination of both process and input–output analysis. Based on the raw project data in the Bill of Quantities, a detailed case study is performed for the structure engineering of six landmark buildings in E-town, Beijing, supported by the virtual water intensity database for the Chinese economy in 2007. The total virtual water of the case buildings is quantified as 1.25E+06 m3, corresponding to an intensity of 20.83 m3 per square meter floor area. On-site tap-water supply, material inputs and manpower inputs contribute to 43.55\%, 50.05\% and 6.31\% of the virtual water, respectively, indicating the fact that off-site water use plays a critical role in balancing the overall water budget of a building.},

abstract = {The performance of a compact phase change material (PCM) solar collector based on latent heat storage was investigated. In this collector, the absorber plate–container unit performs the function of both absorbing the solar energy and storing PCM. The solar energy was stored in paraffin wax, which was used as a PCM, and was discharged to cold water flowing in pipes located inside the wax. The collector's effective area was assumed to be 1m2 and its total volume was divided into 5 sectors. The experimental apparatus was designed to simulate one of the collector's sectors, with an apparatus-absorber effective area of 0.2m2. Outdoor experiments were carried out to demonstrate the applicability of using a compact solar collector for water heating. The time-wise temperatures of the PCM were recorded during the processes of charging and discharging. The solar intensity was recorded during the charging process. Experiments were conducted for different water flow rates of 8.3–21.7kg/h. The effect of the water flow rate on the useful heat gain (Qu) was studied. The heat transfer coefficients were calculated for the charging process. The propagation of the melting and freezing front was also studied during the charging and discharging processes. The experimental results showed that in the charging process, the average heat transfer coefficient increases sharply with increasing the molten layer thickness, as the natural convection grows strong. In the discharge process, the useful heat gain was found to increase as the water mass flow rate increases.},

abstract = {The UK Water Industry currently generates approximately 800GWh pa of electrical energy from sewage sludge. Traditionally energy recovery from sewage sludge features Anaerobic Digestion (AD) with biogas utilisation in combined heat and power (CHP) systems. However, the industry is evolving and a number of developments that extract more energy from sludge are either being implemented or are nearing full scale demonstration. This study compared five technology configurations: 1 - conventional AD with CHP, 2 - Thermal Hydrolysis Process (THP) AD with CHP, 3 - THP AD with bio-methane grid injection, 4 - THP AD with CHP followed by drying of digested sludge for solid fuel production, 5 - THP AD followed by drying, pyrolysis of the digested sludge and use of the both the biogas and the pyrolysis gas in a CHP. The economic and environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) found that both the post AD drying options performed well but the option used to create a solid fuel to displace coal (configuration 4) was the most sustainable solution economically and environmentally, closely followed by the pyrolysis configuration (5). Application of THP improves the financial and environmental performance compared with conventional AD. Producing bio-methane for grid injection (configuration 3) is attractive financially but has the worst environmental impact of all the scenarios, suggesting that the current UK financial incentive policy for bio-methane is not driving best environmental practice. It is clear that new and improving processes and technologies are enabling significant opportunities for further energy recovery from sludge; LCA provides tools for determining the best overall options for particular situations and allows innovation resources and investment to be focused accordingly.},

Parametric studies show the influence of used feedstock, applied process parameters as well as process and heat integration measures on exergy efficiency. It is shown that heat integration and recirculation of fermentor effluents reduce process irreversibilites and the amount of exergy leaving the process in waste streams. Nevertheless, depending on the used feedstock, a large amount of exergy leaves the process via by-products. Internal use of by-products and waste materials for providing process heat could increase chemical exergy efficiency up to 74\%.},

abstract = {Bringing about more sustainable consumption patterns is an important challenge for society and science. In this article the concept of household metabolism is applied to analyzing consumption patterns and to identifying possibilities for the development of sustainable household consumption patterns. Household metabolism is determined in terms of total energy requirements, including both direct and indirect energy requirements, using a hybrid method. This method enables us to evaluate various determinants of the environmental load of consumption consistently at several levels—the national level, the local level, and the household level. The average annual energy requirement of households varies considerably between the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Sweden, as well as within these countries. The average expenditure level per household explains a large part of the observed variations. Differences between these countries are also related to the efficiency of the production sectors and to the energy supply system. The consumption categories of food, transport, and recreation show the largest contributions to the environmental load. A comparison of consumer groups with different household characteristics shows remarkable differences in the division of spending over the consumption categories. Thus, analyses of different types of households are important for providing a basis for options to induce decreases of the environmental load of household consumption. At the city level, options for change are provided by an analysis of the city infrastructure, which determines a large part of the direct energy use by households (for transport and heating). At the national level, energy efficiency in production and in electricity generation is an important trigger for decreasing household energy requirements.},

abstract = {As the world urbanizes, the role of cities in determining sustainability outcomes grows in importance. Cities are the dominant form of human habitat, and most of the world's resources are either directly or indirectly consumed in cities. Sustainable city analysis and management requires understanding the demands a city places on a wider geographical area and its ecological resource base. We present a detailed, integrated urban metabolism of residential consumption and ecological footprint analysis of the Vancouver metropolitan region for the year 2006. Our overall goal is to demonstrate the application of a bottom-up ecological footprint analysis using an urban metabolism framework at a metropolitan, regional scale. Our specific objectives are: a) to quantify energy and material consumption using locally generated data and b) to relate these data to global ecological carrying capacity. Although water is the largest material flow through Metro Vancouver (424,860,000 m(3)), it has the smallest ecological footprint (23,100 gha). Food (2,636,850 tonnes) contributes the largest component to the ecological footprint (4,514,400 gha) which includes crop and grazing land as well as carbon sinks required to sequester emissions from food production and distribution. Transportation fuels (3,339,000 m(3)) associated with motor vehicle operation and passenger air travel comprises the second largest material flow through the region and the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions (7,577,000 tonnes). Transportation also accounts for the second largest component of the EF (2,323,200 gha). Buildings account for the largest electricity flow (17,515,150 MWh) and constitute the third largest component of the EF (1,779,240 gha). Consumables (2,400,000 tonnes) comprise the fourth largest component of the EF (1,414,440 gha). Metro Vancouver's total Ecological Footprint in 2006 was 10,071,670 gha, an area approximately 36 times larger than the region itself. The EFA reveals that cropland and carbon sinks (forested land required to sequester carbon dioxide emissions) account for 90\% of Metro Vancouver's overall demand for biocapacity. The per capita ecological footprint is 4.76 gha, nearly three times the per capita global supply of biocapacity. Note that this value excludes national government services that operate outside the region and could account for up to an additional 2 gha/ca.},

The following indices are reviewed: Ecological Footprint (EF), Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI), Dashboard of Sustainability (DS), Welfare Index, Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare, City Development Index, emergy/exergy, Human Development Index (HDI), Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI), Environmental Policy Index (EPI), Living Planet Index (LPI), Environmentally-adjusted Domestic Product (EDP), Genuine Saving (GS), and some applications of composite indices or/and multivariate indicators to local or regional context as case studies. The key conceptual requirements for an adequate CSI are: (i) to consider environmental, economic and social aspects (the triple bottom line of sustainability) from the viewpoint of strong sustainability; (ii) to capture external impacts (leakage effects) of city on other areas beyond the city boundaries particularly in terms of environmental aspects; (iii) to create indices/indicators originally for the purpose of assessing city sustainability; and (iv) to be able to assess world cities in both developed and developing countries using common axes of evaluation. Based on the review, we conclude that it is necessary to create a new CSI that enables us to assess and compare cities' sustainability performance in order to understand the global impact of cities on the environment and human life as compared with their economic contribution. In the future, the CSI will be able to provide local authorities with guidance toward sustainable paths.},

abstract = {The evaluation of the environmental sustainability of a technological option requires the consideration of the complete product life cycle. By using the methodology of a classical environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), it is possible to analyze the environmental problems of the sugar industry through all stages of the full process including different options for the by-products valorization. Exergy and exergetic life cycle analysis are much more resource and product, and hence also efficiency, oriented. The Cumulative Exergy Consumption (CExC) has the advantage that different kinds of resources are quantified on one single scale, which is a unique feature in resource accounting. In this work, Exergetic Life Cycle Assessment was combined with a traditional LCA of cane sugar production process developed previously by Contreras et al. (Contreras et al., 2009), for assessing four different alternatives for by-products valorization of the cane sugar process. The CExC reports the exergy consumption of each stage of the process and the total consumption for each alternative which is important in resource consumption quantification, including renewability and hence process sustainability. Results show the advantage of combining both methods for the environmental assessment of cane sugar production. The application of this combination validates the results related with the category of resources and the contribution of the agricultural stage to the overall impact of the process. The environmental benefits of producing alcohol, biogas, animal food and fertilizers from the sugar production by-products were corroborated. The alternative IV has the lowest contribution to environmental impact in resource category and the minor value of the non-renewability index (6.59E-08).},

abstract = {Water is required for mining and mineral processing operations. In recent years, the mining industry is facing increasing water demand and increasing competition with other water users. Hence, mine water systems need to be well managed to ensure water is reliably available for mining operations. Energy is required for almost all water processes, such as pumping, treatment, cooling and heating. The management of a mine water system is related to energy use. For strategic mine water management, information about the energy demand directly related to different water management options is usually required to assist in the decision-making process of selecting suitable water management options. This research presents the application of an exergy analysis technique named ‘Physical Hydronomics’ to show critical factors affecting the energy demand of water management options. The analysis identifies focus points where additional energy demand can be reduced or avoided when upgrading a water system. At the same time, energy demand of different water options isalso quantified. The method is demonstrated by assessing the energy demand of three water desalination options of a coal mine. The aim of introducing these water options to the mine is to improve water use efficiency. The exergy analysis technique generates exergy profiles of water flows and presents critical factors related to the energy demand of water flows. At the end of the analysis, total exergy demand of each of the three water desalination options is estimated.},

abstract = {<p>\&nbsp;National infrastructure is as much a priority in countries with a large stock of ageing infrastructural assets as it is for rapidly industrialising economies. Increasing attention is being paid to the risk and opportunities that the growing interdependence between infrastructural systems brings. However, there is no current methodology to enable long-term planning and future performance assessment of interdependent infrastructural systems. This paper makes the case for a long-term, cross-sectoral approach to analysing and planning the performance of national infrastructure systems. Such an approach is required to develop credible long-term visions for infrastructure provision and to analyse system performance across a range of possible futures. A preliminary version of a system-of-systems analysis for the UK is presented as an example. The implementation of a comprehensive, model-based approach is currently well under way.</p>},

abstract = {Hydrogen produced from renewable resources is a promising potential source of clean energy. With the help of low-temperature proton-exchange membrane fuel cells, molecular hydrogen can be converted efficiently to produce electricity. The implementation of sustainable hydrogen production and subsequent hydrogen conversion to energy is called "hydrogen economy". Unfortunately, its physical properties make the transport and handling of hydrogen gas difficult. To overcome this, methanol can be used as a material for the storage of hydrogen, because it is a liquid at room temperature and contains 12.6 per cent hydrogen. However, the state-of-the-art method for the production of hydrogen from methanol (methanol reforming) is conducted at high temperatures (over 200 degrees Celsius) and high pressures (25-50 bar), which limits its potential applications. Here we describe an efficient low-temperature aqueous-phase methanol dehydrogenation process, which is facilitated by ruthenium complexes. Hydrogen generation by this method proceeds at 65-95 degrees Celsius and ambient pressure with excellent catalyst turnover frequencies (4,700 per hour) and turnover numbers (exceeding 350,000). This would make the delivery of hydrogen on mobile devices--and hence the use of methanol as a practical hydrogen carrier--feasible.},

abstract = {Ecosystem theory has been developed during recent decades, thereby a series of concepts are hypothesized to describe principles inherent to the “natural” function of biological systems at various levels of hierarchy. It seems that a universal trend exists, through evolutionary time and space that allows us to establish indicators that may be used to observe patterns in evolution, even at high levels of hierarchy such as the ecosystem level. The functional principles of ecosystems have evolved over a period of time corresponding to the existence of life on earth say 3–4 billion years. The obvious question immediately arises whether we could learn something from observing these principles. Could we possibly improve our existence by living in accordance with these principles practiced in nature, as exemplified by ecosystems? In this paper, a comparison between natural systems on the one side and industrial–societal systems on the other side is made using 10 target areas as entrance points. It turns out that even though industrial ecologists are aware of and are practicing some points in ecosystem theory, far from all principles, have been exploited. It is suggested that society should increase attention to some of the features where natural systems and societal systems differ greatly. It is hypothesized that industry and society, both in terms of economy and sustainability, would benefit from exploiting these natural principles, even more. This would lead to an intended and deliberate development of the industrial sectors and society in general accordance with the natural ecosystem principles. This led the author to propose the eco-mimetic development of our society.},

abstract = {The Danish island Sams\o has since 1997 initiated a process through which the island should reach a state where it would be able to supply its own energy. Such a situation was reached since 2005 – after having established 21 windmills – and the island is now a net exporter of electricity to the Danish power network. At the same time the buildings in the more habituated areas were connected to 4 district heating plants which generate heat from combustion of straw in some cases combined with supplementary inputs from photo thermal devices. Meanwhile, certain activities on the island, such as running the ferries, cars, factories and heating in more distant areas are still dependent on significant input of fossil fuels. The inhabitants have recently stated a wish to move on towards being independent of fossil fuels in 2030 and carbon neutral during the next decades. As a consequence the idea came up to develop a method for the “sustainability analysis” of a society which would assist in governing the transitional process in the direction of increasing sustainability. Therefore, a framework has been developed based on the concept exergy that may reveal where large consumptions are taking places. Such areas are likely to be sensible targets for action or at least increased attention. Basic methods have been developed that allows to account for infrastructure, transfers, inputs and outputs, and consumption in terms of exergy, and taking into account whether the exergy storages or flows can be considered to be renewable or not. The framework has been developed for six societal sectors: the energy sector, the public sector, the private households, the agricultural sector, the industry, commerce and trade sector and nature. Nature is here considered an activity that provides the society with an exergy that may also be of value to our societies, often referred to as ecosystem services. Based on the estimated amount of infrastructure and transfers, inputs and outputs a number of “sustainability indicators” have been developed that may be monitored over time and which may serve to indicate whether potential measures undertaken also lead the society in the right direction. An attempt to evaluate the potential importance of wastes has also been carried out as in organic waste could play an important role in acquiring the amount of bio-diesel required to run the ferries in the future. The results demonstrate that the already existing overhead in production of electricity leaves the island with many options and a great opportunity to be independent of fossil fuels in near future. In fact, it might well be that socio-economical perspectives will turn out to be the more severe obstacles in the transition process. Adjacent to this work a carbon model has also been set up to reveal the consequence of proposed measures and strategies to the carbon budget of the island (J\o rgensen and Nielsen, 2014).},

A theoretical description of each index highlights their advantages and drawbacks, underlining the fact that no indicator is perfect and no one can give an exhaustive view of sustainable development. Therefore, the analysis of various indicators is necessary to evaluate sustainable development with accuracy. Empirical results of measures of well-being show that French development was improving between 1990 and 2000. Concerning sustainability, indicators support different conclusions.

abstract = {Water and energy are both important resources that are inextricably and reciprocally linked. Indeed, energy production requires a lot of water (e.g., cooling water at power plants), and numerous studies have investigated the water footprint of energy production (WFEP). However, energy is typically supplied to domestic consumers by both domestic and foreign producers, so it is necessary to take both internal and external energy productions into account. The aim of this study is to evaluate the water footprints of energy production and supply in Thailand by applying standard water footprint analysis methods based on bottom-up approaches, which define separate footprints based on production and consumption perspectives. Our findings show that the WFEP for 2010 was nine times greater than that for 1986, while the water footprint of energy supply (WFES) was eight times greater because of the use of biomass energy. We discuss external dependency, the impacts on domestic water resources, and policy implications, and we suggest ways to promote a reliable energy supply by limiting the use of water resources for energy production in Thailand.},

The exergy destructions in the overall BGDHS are quantified and illustrated using exergy flow diagram. Furthermore, both energy and exergy flow diagrams are exhibited for comparison purposes. It is observed through analysis that the exergy destructions in the system particularly take place as the exergy of the fluid lost in the pumps, the heat exchanger losses, the exergy of the thermal water (geothermal fluid) reinjected and the natural direct discharge (hot water distribution losses) of the system, accounting for 1.64\%, 8.57\%, 14.84\% and 28.96\%, respectively, of the total exergy input to the BGDHS.

These ambitions were later expressed in the Hammarby Model, an integrated infrastructural system aiming to minimize the metabolic flows of the district by closing its material and energy flows. Various integrated systems were already present in Stockholm when discussions began around the development of the Hammarby Model. Using a conceptual framework inspired by transition theory, this paper analyses the process of designing and building the Hammarby Model. Our aim is to create a better understanding of the implications of systems integration at the urban district level. The findings of the study show that systems integration may both enable and constrain further innovation. On one hand, integration facilitates the implementation of technologies that are add-ons or that solve a reverse salient experienced by the integrated system. On the other hand, technologies that are perceived to threaten the integrated system are locked out, prohibiting further optimization of the system.},

In this article the industrial waste produced in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA) during 2008 is assessed. By applying a Material Flow Analysis methodology, the research identifies the amount of waste that was recovered as well as the Recovery Networks that each transaction is integrated in. Additionally, it was performed an identification of the composition of the waste disposed and the results were computed against a database of waste recovery cases worldwide. Possible recovery solutions of the disposed waste were identified and proposals of improvement of the recovery network are advanced. Results show that a high amount of waste produced by the companies located in the LMA was recovered (791,086 tonnes from the 1,000,091 tonnes of generated waste). The Resource Recovery network processed 43\% of the wastes, In-house reuse, 34\%, and Industrial Symbiosis, 23\%. The recovery solutions identified for the disposal waste show that at least 68\% of the 209,005 tonnes disposed could also be recovered, increasing the total amount for Industrial wasted recovered from 79\% to 94\%. The performance of the waste recovery network in this region supports the results of previous researches and uncovers new behavioural characteristics, namely when comparing Industrial Symbiosis and Resource Recovery.},

abstract = {The principle that energy does not cycle in ecosystems is examined by path and flow analyses of a small, steady state, energy model of an oyster reef community. Path numbers increase combinatorially without bound as path length increases, at much faster rates with energy storage than without. Energy flows over only very short paths in the nonstorage case, but with storage present most flow is associated with long paths. Cycling results. A cycling index modified from the literature standard to include storage shows 11\% cycling in the subject model. Energy does cycle in ecosystems; it differs from matter in its dissipation, not cycling, characteristics. A new result is the role of storage in diversifying path structure and increasing flows in networks. The basis for this is examined through influence theory of mathematical graphs, with the conclusion that energy storage as biomass is the root cause of ecosystem energy cycling. Issues of food chain length and embodied energy are reviewed in light of the long paths and related energy flows present in even small order models.},

@article{Patterson1998,
abstract = {Without a theory of value (price) in ecological economics, the valuation of ecosystem and economic resources cannot be rigorously defended. At the crux of the matter is the `valuation' or `mixed units' problem of commensurating biophysical inputs/outputs which are different. This paper critically reviews candidate theories of value which have emerged in the ecological economics literature for dealing with this problem. First of all, the Neo-Ricardian approach, using Sraffa-type systems is discussed. In particular, Judson's assertion that the Sraffa system is suitable for ecological economics is questioned, as it is based on `circular flow', generation of a `surplus' and `exchange values'. None of these ideas are consistent with a biophysical characterisation of an economic system, which is paramount in ecological economics. A more fruitful avenue for establishing a biophysical theory of value based on ecological and thermodynamic principles, is to extend Patterson's quality equivalent methodology (QEM) to explicitly include mass flows in addition to energy. At this point a model close to Costanza and Hannon's biosphere model of price determination emerges. The extended QEM model however, has a number of important advantages over the Costanza–Hannon model because it has a more generalised formulation and is not reliant on necessarily using solar energy as the numeraire. The paper concludes with a discussion of some outstanding issues that need to be resolved before a biophysical theory of value can be properly established in ecological economics.},

abstract = {The integrated study of energy and urban systems has recently become a critical component of sustainability research and policy. Increasing urbanization of human societies combined with intense energy demands of modern economies have driven a recognition that sustainable practices require a systems approach to both the study and application of sustainability principles. Urban metabolism has emerged as a leading methodology for quantifying energy consumption and use patterns in urban environments. Though typically applied as a method of accounting for total energy and materials inputs and outputs into cities, its interdisciplinary history and methods allow urban metabolism to be expanded in ways that will allow more comprehensive and integrated assessment of the patterns and processes of urban energy systems. In this article, we review the concept of urban metabolism—including its two typical approaches: mass balance and “emergy” methods—and offer a means to expand urban metabolism into a platform that incorporates socioeconomic analysis, policy analysis, and additional quantitative methodologies (such as life cycle assessment). This expanded urban metabolism framework is more comprehensive analytically and builds upon the documented capacity of traditional urban metabolism to account for total energy and materials flows of cities to provide an integrated platform for analysis of both energy patterns and the causal processes that govern energy in contemporary cities.},

abstract = {Fermentation of dilute sulfuric acid barley straw hydrolysate (BSH; undiluted/untreated) by Clostridium beijerinckii P260 resulted in the production of 7.09 gL-1 ABE (acetone butanol ethanol), an ABE yield of 0.33, and productivity of 0.10 gL-1 h-1. This level of ABE is much less than that observed in a control experiment (21.06 gL-1) where glucose (initial concentration 60 gL-1) was used as a substrate. In the control experiment, an ABE yield of 0.41 and productivity of 0.31 gL-1 h-1 were observed. This comparison suggested that BSH is toxic to the culture. To reduce this potential toxicity effect, BSH was treated with lime [Ca(OH)2] followed by fermentation. The treated BSH resulted in a successful fermentation and ABE concentration of 26.64 gL-1 was achieved. This was superior to both glucose and untreated BSH (initial sugar 60 gL-1) fermentations. In this fermentation, an ABE yield of 0.43 and productivity of 0.39 gL-1 h-1 (390\% of untreated/undiluted BSH) was obtained. It should be noted that using lime treated BSH, a specific productivity of 0.55 h-1 was obtained as compared to 0.12 h-1 in the control fermentation suggesting that more carbon was directed to product formation.},

abstract = {Urban areas manage vast quantities of energy, water and waste resources. In order to minimise the cost and
environmental impact, optimisation modelling is often used in the design and operation of these systems. However,
traditional modelling approaches only consider the energy, water and waste sectors in isolation. This approach
neglects the synergies possible between these systems whereby outputs from one system form an input to another,
and hence sets an upper bound on economic and environmental impact minimisation. We formulate a mixed integer
linear programming (MILP) model which takes a ‘systems-of-infrastructure systems’ approach to show how resource
consumption can be reduced. The model takes as inputs possible resource conversion and transportation infrastructure
and resources, and resource demands, and returns the optimal infrastructure choice and layout. The model is called
PRaQ because it models ‘processes, resources and qualities.’ We apply the model to the design of a new urban
development in China for three scenarios of various levels of resource integration. Results are still to be obtained.},

abstract = {In this paper, bioenergy technologies (BETs) are presented as potential carbon abatement opportunities substituting fossil fuel or traditional (less efficient) biomass energy systems. Cost of energy (produced or saved) of BETs is compared with fossil fuel and traditional biomass energy systems to estimate the incremental cost (IC). The IC of carbon abatement for each of the selected BETs (in \$ kWh-1 or \$ GJ-1) is estimated using the carbon emission (tC kWh-1 or tC GJ-1) reduction obtained by substituting fossil fuel and traditional biomass alternatives. The abatement costs are estimated and compared for ten combinations of BETs (with seven technology alternatives) substituting conventional technologies. The analysis indicates that out of the ten project cases six have negative ICs in the range of -37 to -688 \$ tC-1 and four have positive ICs in the range of 52-162 \$ tC-1 mitigation. The negative ICs indicate that the suggested alternatives are cheaper than the original technologies. Thus, results indicate that the chosen BETs are cost-effective mitigation opportunities and are currently aggressive candidates under Clean Development Mechanism. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a robust technology and is ready to be tested and used on a larger scale for CO2 capture from coal-fired power plants. The minimum work requirement to separate CO2 from coal-fired flue gas and compress CO2 to 150 bar is 0.11 megawatt-hours per metric ton of CO2. Process and solvent improvements should reduce the energy consumption to 0.2 megawatt-hour per ton of CO2. Other advanced technologies will not provide energy-efficient or timely solutions to CO2 emission from conventional coal-fired power plants.},

abstract = {The exergy of an energy form or a substance is a measure of its usefulness or quality or potential to cause change. A thorough understanding of exergy and the insights it can provide into the efficiency, environmental impact and sustainability of energy systems, are required for the engineer or scientist working in the area of energy systems and the environment. Further, as energy policies play an increasingly important role in addressing sustainability issues and a broad range of local, regional and global environmental concerns, policy makers also need to appreciate the exergy concept and its ties to these concerns. During the past decade, the need to understand the connections between exergy and energy, sustainable development and environmental impact has become increasingly significant. In this paper, a study of these connections is presented in order to provide to those involved in energy and environment studies, useful insights and direction for analyzing and solving environmental problems of varying complexity using the exergy concept. The results suggest that exergy provides the basis for an effective measure of the potential of a substance or energy form to impact the environment and appears to be a critical consideration in achieving sustainable development.},

It is found that for the city of Athens, where the mean heat island intensity exceeds 10°C, the cooling load of urban buildings may be doubled, the peak electricity load for cooling purposes may be tripled especially for higher set point temperatures, while the minimum COP value of air conditioners may be decreased up to 25\% because of the higher ambient temperatures. During the winter period, the heating load of centrally located urban buildings is found to be reduced up to 30\%. Regarding the potential of natural ventilation techniques when applied to buildings located in urban canyons, it is found that, mainly during the day, this is seriously reduced because of the important decrease of the wind speed inside the canyon. Air flow reduction may be up to 10 times the flow that corresponds to undisturbed ambient wind conditions.},

Conventional crops such as corn and sugarcane are unable to meet the global demand of bioethanol production due to their primary value of food and feed. Therefore, lignocellulosic substances such as agricultural wastes are attractive feedstocks for bioethanol production. Agricultural wastes are cost effective, renewable and abundant. Bioethanol from agricultural waste could be a promising technology though the process has several challenges and limitations such as biomass transport and handling, and efficient pretreatment methods for total delignification of lignocellulosics. Proper pretreatment methods can increase concentrations of fermentable sugars after enzymatic saccharification, thereby improving the efficiency of the whole process. Conversion of glucose as well as xylose to ethanol needs some new fermentation technologies, to make the whole process cost effective.

Numerous initiatives have provided incentives for organizations to become more environmentally benign. Some of these regulation driven programs are mandatory, but increasingly numerous voluntary environmental programs are also introduced by organizations. Organizations view many of these environmental programs, which may include technological and organizational development projects, as possible alternatives for gaining or maintaining a competitive advantage. One environmental program area that continues to gain in importance is one that focuses on the external relationships among organizations. To help evaluate alternatives that will effect this relationship we present a strategic decision framework that will aid managerial decision-making. This decision framework is based on literature and practice in the area of environmentally conscious business practices. The focus of this paper will be on the components and elements of green supply chain management and how they serve as a foundation for the decision framework. We shall explore the applicability of a dynamic non-linear multiattribute decision model, defined as the analytical network process, for decision making within the green supply chain.

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to the evaluation of energy conversion processes and systems, based on an extended representation of their exergy flow diagram. This approach is a systematic attempt to integrate into a unified coherent formalism both Cumulative Exergy Consumption and Thermo-economic methods, and constitutes a generalisation of both, in that its framework allows for a direct quantitative comparison of non-energetic quantities like labour and environmental impact (hence the apposition ‘Extended’). A critical examination of the existing state-of-the-art of energy- and exergy analysis methods and paradigms indicates that an extension of the existing ‘Design and Optimisation’ procedures to include explicitly ‘non-energetic externalities’ is indeed feasible. It appears that it can indeed be successfully argued that some of the issues that are difficult to address with a purely monetary theory of value can be resolved by Extended Exergy Accounting (‘EEA’ in the following) methods without introducing arbitrary assumptions external to the theory. In this respect, EEA can be regarded as a natural development of the economic theory of production of commodities, which it extends by properly accounting for the unavoidable energy dissipation in the productive chain. While a systematic description of the EEA theory is discussed in previous work by the same author, the present paper aims at a more specific target, and presents a formal representation of the application of EEA to a cogenerating plant based on a gas turbine process. It is shown that the solution indeed leads to an ‘optimal’ design, and that its formalism embeds even extended Thermo-economic formulations.},

abstract = {The paper discusses the similarities and the incompatibilities between two forms of Energy Analysis (exergy and emergy, ‘EXA’ and ‘EMA’ in the following), both of which try to represent the behavior of physical systems by means of cumulative energy input/output methods that result in a double integration over space and time domains. Theoretical background, definitions and balance algebra are discussed first, in a ‘statement–counterstatement’ format that helps pinpointing differences and similarities. A significant, albeit simplified, benchmark case (ethanol production from corn) is used to compare the results and analytically assess the merits of each approach as well as possible synergic aspects. Corn production, transport and industrial conversion to ethanol are included in the analysis. First, mass balance and energy accounting are performed in each step of the process, then, exergy and emergy evaluations are carried out separately to lead to a set of performance indicators, the meaning of which is discussed with reference to their proper scale of application. The Authors underline that each method has its own preferred field of application and conclude that the two approaches appear to be characterized not much as different (and therefore competing) tools, but as different paradigms, whose meta-levels (their ‘philosophies’) substantially differ. In particular, EXA is found to provide the most correct and insightful assessment of thermodynamic features of any process and to offer a clear quantitative indication of both the irreversibilities and the degree of matching between the used resources and the end-use material or energy flows. EXA combined with costing considerations results in Thermo-Economics (TE), presently the best engineering method for System optimization. One of EXA recent extensions, Extended Exergy Accounting (EEA) includes all externalities in the exergy resource accounting, thus providing a more complete picture of how a process is interacting with its socio-economical environment and with the Biosphere. EMA further expands the evaluation to the larger scale of the Biosphere and properly accounts for the globality of the energy and resource flows supporting complex living systems. Although some conceptual assumptions and methodological differences appear irreconcilable, important similarities are also found that may lead to further methodological and practical convergences. Note: Although a significant confrontation and debate accompanied the development of this paper, contrasting opinions about important features of the two approaches still exist. Therefore, SU takes full responsibility of statements in Sections 2, 4.1, 6.2, 7.1 while ES takes full responsibility of statements in Sections 3, 4.2, 6.1, 7.2. All remaining Sections reflect points of view agreed upon by both Authors.},

This paper partially addresses this shortcoming by tracing some of the historical and intellectual antecedents of the field, providing a clear and concise lexicon of the biological analogue, and contrasting the two most promising analytical methods by which IE research may be carried out: life cycle assessment (LCA) and systems analysis. Although a number of comparative environmental metrics may be employed in cost-minimization or thermodynamic efficiency studies, no single measure is sufficiently developed to prioritize among qualitatively disparate types of environmental impacts. It is argued herein that the concept of chemical exergy of mixing may be the most promising basis for the development of a uniform, broad-based measure of chemical pollution, and that such a measure could significantly advance a scientific approach to IE.

abstract = {Academic and corporate interest in sustainable supply chain management has risen considerably in recent years. This can be seen by the number of papers published and in particular by journal special issues. To establish the field further, the purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it offers a literature review on sustainable supply chain management taking 191 papers published from 1994 to 2007 into account. Second, it offers a conceptual framework to summarize the research in this field comprising three parts. As starting point related triggers are identified. This allows putting forward two distinct strategies: (1) supplier management for risks and performance, and (2) supply chain management for sustainable products. It is evident that research is still dominated by green/environmental issues. Social aspects and also the integration of the three dimensions of sustainability are still rare. Both practitioners in companies and academics might find the review useful, as it outlines major lines of research in the field. Further, it discusses specific features of sustainable supply chains as well as limitations of existing research; this should stimulate further research.},

PCMs have been widely used in latent heat thermal-storage systems for heat pumps, solar engineering, and spacecraft thermal control applications. The uses of PCMs for heating and cooling applications for buildings have been investigated within the past decade. There are large numbers of PCMs that melt and solidify at a wide range of temperatures, making them attractive in a number of applications.

abstract = {The growing concern for energy, economy and environment calls for an efficient utilization of natural energy resources in developing useful work. An important thermodynamic aspect in gauging the overall energy economy of any physical process is the combined energy and exergy analysis from the identification of process irreversibilities. The present paper makes a comprehensive review pertaining to fundamental studies on thermodynamic irreversibility and exergy analysis in the processes of combustion of gaseous, liquid and solid fuels. The need for such investigations in the context of combustion processes in practice is first stressed upon and then the various approaches of exergy analysis and the results arrived at by different research workers in the field have been discussed. It has been recognized that, in almost all situations, the major source of irreversibilities is the internal thermal energy exchange associated with high-temperature gradients caused by heat release in combustion reactions. The primary way of keeping the exergy destruction in a combustion process within a reasonable limit is to reduce the irreversibility in heat conduction through proper control of physical processes and chemical reactions resulting in a high value of flame temperature but lower values of temperature gradients within the system. The optimum operating condition in this context can be determined from the parametric studies on combustion irreversibilities with operating parameters in different types of flames.},

Essentially, all of this biofuel was produced from crops developed for food production, raising concerns about the net energy and greenhouse gas effects and potential competition between use of land for production of fuels, food, animal feed, fiber, and ecosystem services. The pending implementation of improved technologies to more effectively convert the nonedible parts of plants (lignocellulose) to liquid fuels opens diverse options to use biofuel feedstocks that reach beyond current crops and the land currently used for food and feed. However, there has been relatively little discussion of what types of plants may be useful as bioenergy crops.},

Solid waste has become one of the global environmental issues. Continuous depletion of natural finite resources is leading the globe to an uncertain future. To prevent further depletion of global resources, sustainable consumption and a strategic waste management system would be required. One approach that has been suggested as a means of addressing these concerns is that of the concepts of “Zero Waste”. However, transforming currently over-consuming activities into zero waste is still challenging. In this study, the challenges of solid waste (focusing on industrial waste e-waste, food waste and packaging waste), zero waste practices, and zero waste strategy were discussed to analyze the challenges and opportunities to transform traditional waste management toward zero waste vision. “Zero Waste” is a good solution to minimizing the increasing solid waste. However, in order to minimize the solid waste, there are still more endeavors need to be done in future.},

abstract = {Methods and indicators are needed to assess the urban ecosystem health status, amongst which energy and material metabolism should be integrated to enhance understanding of ecological patterns and processes of urban ecosystems. Therefore, emergy synthesis combining energetics with systems ecology is applied to assess systematically the health status of urban ecosystems. Combining ecosystem health levels with spatial geographical information of different land use subsystems, the spatial distribution of urban ecosystem health is obtained, which is helpful for urban ecological regulation and spatial optimization. Taking the situation of Guangzhou, China in 2005 as a case study, the relative health states based on emergy indicators and set pair analysis is evaluated. Results show that the health levels of the cultivated land, as well as areas with middle and low density buildings are relatively positive, while that of high density building and traffic areas are relatively weak. Through analysis of different land use subsystems, required factors of a healthy ecosystem are summarized, including moderate economic productivity but without much exploitation and disturbance, reasonable structure of energy and resources usage, medium resilience under pressure, moderate ecosystem service provisioning, and small environmental impact on surroundings. The spatial distribution of urban ecosystem health states is also obtained, such that the northern part of Guangzhou is defined as the conservation area, the middle and southern parts are defined as the maintenance area, while the south central and south western parts are defined as the key regulation area where a suitable scheme should be implemented to control the population density and resolve the concomitant problems. Moreover, the impact power of different indicators on the final health status is classified into five levels when combining the indicator weights with the main assessment factors of urban ecosystem health, which is useful for defining the regulation priority amongst a few indicators.},

abstract = {The paper assesses the life cycle of biodiesel from used cooking oil (UCO). Such life cycle involves 4 stages: 1) collection, 2) pre-treatment, 3) delivery and 4) transesterification of UCO. Generally, UCO is collected from restaurants, food industries and recycling centres by authorised companies. Then, UCO is pre-treated to remove solid particles and water to increase its quality. After that, it is charged in cistern trucks and delivered to the biodiesel facility to be then transesterified with methanol to biodiesel. The production of 1 ton of biodiesel is evaluated by a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to assess the environmental impact and by an Exergetic Life Cycle Assessment (ELCA) to account for the exergy input to the system. A detailed list of material and energy inputs is done using data from local companies and completed using Ecoinvent 1.2 database. The results show that the transesterification stage causes 68\% of the total environmental impact. The major exergy inputs are uranium and natural gas. If targets set by the Spanish Renewable Energy Plan are achieved, the exergy input for producing biodiesel would be reduced by 8\% in the present system and consequently environmental impacts and exergy input reduced up to 36\% in 2010. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years, research was intensified on this device as it is being progressively adopted as premier technology to convert low-temperature heat resources into power. Available heat resources are: solar energy, geothermal energy, biomass products, surface seawater, and waste heat from various thermal processes. This paper presents existing applications and analyzes their maturity. Binary geothermal and binary biomass CHP are already mature. Provided the interest to recover waste heat rejected by thermal devices and industrial processes continue to grow, and favorable legislative conditions are adopted, waste heat recovery organic Rankine cycle systems in the near future will experience a rapid growth. Solar modular power plants are being intensely investigated at smaller scale for cogeneration applications in buildings but larger plants are also expected in tropical or Sahel regions with constant and low solar radiation intensity.

abstract = {The non-linear, unexpected and severe responses of ecosystems to the environmental changes crossing ecological thresholds or environmental limits, necessitate the regular monitoring of the human-induced pressures to the urban ecosystems. The present study aims to introduce a spatial decision support system for sustainable environmental planning and management of urban ecosystems by establishing an Urban Carrying Capacity Load Number model (UCCLN) based on carrying capacity concepts and sustainability principles .This model, by applying 30 temporal and spatial indicators continuously monitors the environmental loads on the urban ecosystems. Environmental load was represented by load number index. It was calculated in each zone of study area (urban districts). Geographical Information System (GIS) was used to establish UCCLN model and Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS). The study area was Tehran metropolis, the capital of Iran. The results showed that none of the 115 urban districts of Tehran had optimal Total Load Number (TLN) ranging from (10 to100); 7 districts (6\%) had low-to-medium range of TLN (TLN=100–200); 11 districts (9.5\%) had medium-to-high range (TLN=200–300); 57 districts (49.5\%) had high-to-very high range (TLN=300–400); 40 districts (34.7\%) had the TLN range of very high-to-critical (TLN=400–500); and none of them had the TLN of 500. Furthermore, the results revealed that Tehran has already overshot its ecological thresholds. Not only most of the 30 indicators of environmental pressure in most of the districts (85\%) had high DCC and LN scores, but also most of the 115 districts obtained high DCC, and as a result LN scores. The need for developing more efficient urban planning and management strategies to cope with the increasing environmental loads in the study area is inevitable.},

abstract = {This article proposes a procedure for strategic technology scanning, an activity that has received insufficient attention in the literature to date. Strategic technology scanning is needed to strengthen the link between technology and corporate strategy. This link is ever present although not always explicitly managed. For instance, while it is commonly recognized that the corporate mission dictates the technological interests of the organization, it is not always sufficiently emphasized that it is the quality of technology foresight that shapes the corporate mission in the first place. Scanning enhances technology foresight by seeking major distinguishing features in the technological landscape. These features are termed landmark technologies and serve as indicators of evolving technological and economic potential. For the strategic manager landmark technologies can become focal points for understanding the external environment, very much as core competencies have become focal points for understanding the internal capabilities of the organization. The scanning procedure proposed here is tailored to fit conventional procedures for strategic planning. However, it employs new theoretical structures from the field of strategic technology analysis; and calls for involvement of all levels of the corporate hierarchy-from the corporate board to the technology analyst. It seeks to maximize corporate learning.},

abstract = {This study quantifies the water footprint of consumption (WFcons) and production (WFprod) of Milan. The current WFcons amounts to 6,139 l/cap/d (a volume of 2.93 km(3) annually), of which 52 l/cap/d (1\%) is attributed to domestic water, 448 l/cap/d (7\%) to the consumption of industrial products and 5,639 l/cap/d (92\%) to the consumption of agricultural products. The WFprod is 52 l/cap/d. Milan is thus a net virtual water importer, predominantly through the import of agricultural products. These are produced outside city borders, both in Italy and abroad. This shows the dependency of city dwellers on water resources from other river basins. In addition, the WFcons for a healthy diet (based on Mediterranean Food-Based Dietary Guidelines) and a vegetarian diet are analysed. The current Milanese diet consists of too much sugar, crop oils, meat, animal fats, milk and milk products and not enough cereals, rice, potatoes, vegetables and fruit. The latter two diets result in substantial WFcons reductions: -29\% (to 4,339 l/cap/d) for a healthy diet and -41\% (to 3,631 l/cap/d) for a vegetarian diet. Indeed, a lot of water could be saved by Milan citizens through a change in their diet. A sustainable city should account for its impacts beyond its borders.},

abstract = {In our continued effort in reducing resource consumption, greener technologies such as rainwater harvesting could be very useful in diminishing our dependence on desalinated or treated water and the associated energy requirements. This paper applies exergy analysis and exergetic efficiency to evaluate the performance of eight different scenarios of urban rainwater harvesting systems in the Mediterranean-climate Metropolitan Area of Barcelona where water is a scarce resource. A life cycle approach is taken, where the production, use, and end-of-life stages of these rainwater harvesting systems are quantified in terms of energy and material requirements in order to produce 1m3 of rainwater per year for laundry purposes. The results show that the highest exergy input is associated with the energy uses, namely the transport of the materials to construct the rainwater harvesting systems. The scenario with the highest exergetic efficiency considers a 24 household building with a 21m3 rainwater storage tank installed below roof. Exergy requirements could be minimized by material substitution, minimizing weight or distance traveled.},

@article{VillarroelWalker2014,
abstract = {Urban areas are considered net consumers of materials and energy, attracting these from the surrounding hinterland and other parts of the planet. The way these flows are transformed and returned to the environment by the city is important for addressing questions of sustainability and the effect of human behavior on the metabolism of the city. The present work explores these questions with the use of systems analysis, specifically in the form of a Multi-sectoral Systems Analysis (MSA), a tool for research and for supporting decision-making for policy and investment. The application of MSA is illustrated in the context of Greater London, with these three objectives: (a) estimating resource fluxes (nutrients, water and energy) entering, leaving and circulating within the city-watershed system; (b) revealing the synergies and antagonisms resulting from various combinations of water-sector innovations; and (c) estimating the economic benefits associated with implementing these technologies, from the point of view of production of fertilizer and energy, and the reduction of greenhouse gases. Results show that the selection of the best technological innovation depends on which resource is the focus for improvement. Urine separation can potentially recover 47\% of the nitrogen in the food consumed in London, with revenue of \$33 M per annum from fertilizer production. Collecting food waste in sewers together with growing algae in wastewater treatment plants could beneficially increase the amount of carbon release from renewable energy by 66\%, with potential annual revenues of \$58 M from fuel production.},

abstract = {Cities and regions depend on resources and ecological services from distant ecosystems. The well-being of city and region residents is affected by both the health and availability of these ecosystems, especially in today's ecologically strained world. The management of a city or region's resource metabolism, including the natural capital that supports these flows, is becoming increasingly a central concern to cities and regions that want to succeed. Urban infrastructure is long-lasting and influences resource needs for decades to come: which cities are building future resource traps, and which are opportunities for resource-efficient and more competitive lifestyles? Reliable measures comparing the supply of natural capital to human demand are indispensable for managing resource metabolism, as they help identify challenges, set targets, track progress and drive policies for sustainability. This paper describes one such measurement tool: the Ecological Footprint. After explaining the assumptions behind the Footprint and describing some representative findings, it provides examples of how this resource accounting tool can assist local governments in managing their ecological assets, and support their sustainability efforts.},

abstract = {Hydropower plays a major role in the Canadian electricity generation industry. Few attempts have been made, however, to assess the efficiency of hydropower generation in Canada. This paper analyzes the overall efficiency of hydropower generation in Canada from comprehensive viewpoints of electricity generating capability, its profitability, as well as environmental benefits and social responsibility using the TOPSIS (the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method. The factors that influence the efficiency of the hydropower generation are also presented to help to the sustainable hydropower production in Canada. The most important results of this study concern (1) the pivotal roles of energy saving and of the social responsibility in the overall efficiency of hydropower corporates and (2) the lower hydropower generation efficiency of some of the most important economic regions in Canada. Other results reveal that the overall efficiency of hydropower generation in Canada experienced an improvement in 2012, following a downtrend from 2005 to 2011. Amidst these influencing factors, energy saving and social responsibility are key factors in the overall efficiency scores while management (defined herein by the number of employees and hydropower stations of a corporation) has only a slightly negative impact on the overall efficiency score.},

The productivity of these photosynthetic microorganisms in converting carbon dioxide into carbon-rich lipids, only a step or two away from biodiesel, greatly exceeds that of agricultural oleaginous crops, without competing for arable land. Worldwide, research and demonstration programs are being carried out to develop the technology needed to expand algal lipid production from a craft to a major industrial process. Although microalgae are not yet produced at large scale for bulk applications, recent advances-particularly in the methods of systems biology, genetic engineering, and biorefining-present opportunities to develop this process in a sustainable and economical way within the next 10 to 15 years.},

abstract = {The cross-boundary environmental effects of urban household metabolism are of increasing interest in the context of global climate change and the sustainability of urban systems. To assess resource exchanges and environmental emissions, urban household metabolism was investigated using an ‘emergy synthesis framework’, with the city of Xiamen providing case study data. Two data sets, one from the highly urbanized Xiamen Island (XI) and the other from the less urbanized Xiamen Mainland (XM), were collected and analyzed using an ‘urban spatial conceptual framework’. Household consumption and its spatial environmental effects are embodied by exchanges of resources, energy, services, and wastes between the urban system's physical footprint (‘Urban Sprawl Region’, USR), and its ecological footprint (‘Urban Footprint Region’, UFR). The results show that Xiamen's USR is connected to its UFRs by approximately 98.74\% emergy flows. The distinct emergy indicators identified within the results show that the driving forces, processes, influences, efficiency and sustainability of household metabolism vary dramatically between XI and XM, demonstrating that different urban and social contexts significantly affect household metabolism. The Emergy Sustainability Index reveals that USR households need to make lifestyles changes to sustain development. The employed frameworks (urban spatial conceptual framework and emergy synthesis framework) enable the computation of household consumption and cross-boundary environmental effects. The results may help foster alternative household consumption strategies which could result in more equitable resource allocation and effective mitigation of cross-boundary environmental influences.},

abstract = {Zero waste is a visionary concept for confronting waste problems in our society. The idea is being developed and implemented in various sectors including waste management and treatment, mining, manufacturing, and urban development. The zero waste concept has been embraced by policymakers because it stimulates sustainable production and consumption, optimum recycling and resource recovery. Professionals in waste management systems, however, perceive and apply it in different ways. This study aims to conceptualize zero waste development based on a critical review of available academic journal publications. Very few studies have been found in the domains of zero waste design, assessment and evaluation that have examined production, and sustainable consumption. This study reveals that the scope of the zero waste studies is diverse, and a zero waste concept is constantly developing through various programmes, plans, policies and strategies. The findings of this review study suggest that the zero waste programmes are applied in many countries without any holistic zero waste strategy. The study emphasizes that countries might be able to achieve zero waste goals by developing a national zero waste strategy and by integrating and promoting zero waste initiatives (in communities and industry) through waste management policy. This article presents a critical review of the major studies conducted by researchers on zero waste in the last decades. Based on the review findings the study concludes that zero waste concept has been applied widely in different phases of production and waste management systems. The findings of the study assist to identify priority areas of zero waste strategy and to develop national zero waste guidelines. Thus, this study can be useful to policy and decision makers in developing the evidence-based zero waste guidelines.},

abstract = {Waste is the symbol of inefficiency of any modern society and a representation of misallocated resources. Significant progress has been achieved in reducing waste but it varies from city to city. Currently, cities use their waste diversion rate as a tool to measure the performance of their waste management systems. However, diversion of waste from landfill does not give a holistic picture of zero waste performance. This paper conceptualises the concept of the ‘zero waste city’ and proposes a new tool to measure the performance of waste management systems called the ‘zero waste index’. The zero waste index forecasts the amount of virgin materials, energy, water and greenhouse gas emissions substituted by the resources that are recovered from waste streams. Three high consuming cities (Adelaide, San Francisco and Stockholm) were analysed using the zero waste index. The zero waste indexes in Adelaide, San Francisco and Stockholm were found to be 0.23, 0.51 and 0.17 respectively (i.e. around 23\%, 51\% and 17\% of resources were recovered and potentially substituted for virgin materials). In addition, the zero waste index estimated the potential energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) and water savings due to resource recovery from municipal solid waste in each of the three cities. It is evident that the zero waste index is an innovative tool to assess waste management performance and materials substitution by waste management systems in different cities.},

Exergy analysis is applied to elucidate the resources flows from the natural environment into the society, between other countries or regions and the society, between the sectors of the society, and the emissions outflows into the natural environment from different sectors. For the China society broken down into seven sectors (i.e., extraction, conversion, agriculture, industry, transportation, tertiary and households) as one of the most complicated cases, systems account of environmental emissions as greenhouse gases and “three wastes” is carried out for the first time, combined with an updated resources account. The total societal exergy consumption amounts to 101.1EJ, of which 93.6\% is due to resources use accounted as 94.6EJ, of which 23.2\% is by the industry sector, 22.8\% by conversion, 20.4\% by households, 12.3\% by agriculture, 9.0\% by tertiary, 6.9\% by extraction and 5.4\% by transport, and 6.4\% due to environmental emissions accounted as 6481.6PJ, including greenhouse gas emissions of 5706.1PJ, with the highly remarkable fraction of 49.05\% from CH4 of the same importance as 50.91\% from CO2 and only 0.04\% from N2O, and “three wastes” emissions of only 775.5PJ. The extraction sector is shown as the leading emitter with 32.6\% of the total emissions, followed by the industry with 20.0\%, agriculture with 17.3\%, and conversion sector with 16.8\%. To characterize the network performance in context of environmental resources from a systems ecological perspective, exergy-based ecological efficiency and resources conversion coefficient are found as 88.8\% and 91.3\% for the extraction sector, 29.0\% and 30.0\% for the conversion sector, 31.5\% and 33.5\% for the agriculture sector, 34.8\% and 36.1\% for the industry sector, 16.3\% and 17.3\% for the transportation sector, 38.4\% and 38.5\% for the tertiary sector, and only 1.3\% and 1.3\% for the households sector, respectively. Comparisons with other societies and with China society in previous years are made to further illustrate the physical sustainability of the societal system on the international and development horizons.},

Based on ecological thermodynamics, an indicator system is established in this paper to evaluate the fluxes, stocks, and effiency of the urban material metabolism using emergy analysis. Also, a new model for the urban material metabolism is proposed to define the production possibility curve using a wealth index (WI) and an ecological effiency index (EEI). Then, six large Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen are selected as typical cases to validate the proposed model. The results show that Shenzhen has the highest metabolic capacity, followed by Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Chongqing. It is also reflected that different urban material metabolisms of the six cities are resulted from the varied regional metabolic capacities, thus providing insights into how cities improve their metabolic capacities. Meanwhile, Shenzhen has the highest WI and EEI, Chongqing has the lowest WI and EEI, and Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou has low WI and high EEI. It is also shown that the sustainable operation of the urban material metabolism reflects the mutualism and symbiosis between socioeconomic development and ecological environment protection.},

abstract = {The keys of studying urban sustainable development are material metabolism flux and efficiency. Metabolism flux of urban materials can only reflect the metabolism velocity, while its eco-efficiency can determine the metabolism capacity to support socio-economic development. The general model and the measure model of the eco-efficiency were set up, based on the source recycle (decreasing the consumption of crude resources) and the terminal recycle (decreasing the discharge of pollutants) of production and life. These models were employed to study material metabolism flux and efficiency in Shenzhen, China. Results showed that water, energy and waste metabolism fluxes have increased since 1998 with constant socio-economic development, and their eco-efficiencies have also increased rapidly. When GDP rose by 2.7 times, the metabolism fluxes of urban water and electricity rose by 1.5 and 3.0 times, respectively. When the added value of industry rose by 3.7 times, the metabolism fluxes of industrial water, electricity, energy and waste rose by 1.9, 3.5, 2.7 and 2.0 times, respectively. When population rose by 1.5 times, the metabolism fluxes of residential water and electricity rose by 1.8 and 1.7 times, respectively. During the period, the resource efficiency, environmental efficiency and eco-efficiency rose by 1.8, 3.7 and 2.3 times, respectively. Whereas the efficiency of material metabolism has been improved in Shenzhen, the scarcity of material resources has become more and more serious. Therefore, it is necessary to further improve the efficiency of material metabolism. The keys of improving the eco-efficiency of urban material metabolism are the increasing of resource and environmental efficiencies, and the establishing of the recycling chain of re-utilization of waste resources.},

We used network pathways and network utility analysis to analyze the basic network structure of the urban metabolic system and the complex ecological relationships within the system, providing a new way to perform such research. Using four Chinese cities as examples, we developed an ecological network model of the urban metabolic system. By using network pathway analysis, we studied the changing relationships between metabolic length and the number of metabolic pathways, and between metabolic length and reachability. Based on the distribution of the number of metabolic pathways, we describe the basic structure and intercompartment relationships of the system. By using the sign distribution in the network utility matrix, we determined the ecological relationships and degree of mutualism between the compartments of the system. The basic components of the system consisted of the internal environment, the external environment, and the agricultural, industrial, and domestic sectors. With increasing metabolic length, the ecological relationships among the components of the system became more diverse, and the numbers of metabolic paths and their reachability improved. Although the basic network structure of the four cities was identical, the mutualism index differed. Beijing's mutualism index was superior to that of Shanghai, and much higher than those of Tianjin and Chongqing. By analyzing the structure and function of the urban metabolic system, we provide suggestions for optimizing the structure and adjusting the relationships, and propose methods for the application of ecological network analysis in future urban system research.},

abstract = {Cities (“urban superorganisms”) exhibit metabolic processes. Disturbance of these processes results from the high throughput of the socioeconomic system as a result of the flow of resources between it and its surroundings. Based on systematic ecology and emergy synthesis, we developed an emergy-based indicator system for evaluating urban metabolic factors (flux, structures, intensity, efficiency, and density), and evaluated the status of Beijing's environment and economic development by diagramming, accounting for, and analyzing the material, energy, and monetary flows within Beijing's metabolic system using biophysically based ecological accounting. We also compared the results with those of four other Chinese cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Ningbo, and Baotou) and China as a whole to assess Beijing's development status. From 1990 to 2004, Beijing's metabolic flux, metabolic intensity, and metabolic density increased significantly. The city's metabolic processes depend excessively on nonrenewable resources, but the pressure on resources from outside of the city decreased continuously. The metabolic efficiency increased by around 12\% annually throughout the study period. Beijing had a highest metabolic fluxes and density compared with the four other cities; its metabolic efficiency was lower, and its metabolic intensity was higher. Evaluating these metabolic indicators revealed weaknesses in the urban metabolic system, thereby helping planners to identify measures capable of sustaining these urban metabolic processes.},

abstract = {Based on urban metabolism theory, urban energy consumption and carbon emission can be analyzed and the urban energy structure and carbon metabolic processes can be specified. By combining input–output analysis with ecological network analysis, the embodied energy and carbon footprint implied in urban products and services can be quantified. On this basis, we introduced energy structure indices based on the embodied energy per unit carbon emitted (i.e., the emission efficiency), which we used to evaluate the energy structure attributes of the metabolic actors. This approach provides a scientific basis for energy conservation and carbon emission reduction. Beijing is trying to control pollution (especially the smog produced by coal combustion), and this task is complicated by its large metabolic fluxes and strong metabolic influence. In this study, we analyzed the energy consumption structure of 28 sectors in Beijing from the perspective of their carbon footprint, and divided the sectors into four categories based on the relationship between their embodied energy consumption and the emission efficiency. We found that most sectors had high energy consumption and low emission efficiency, and that from 2000 to 2010, Beijing's overall consumption structure alternated between high and low embodied energy per unit of carbon emission, but the overall trend of emission efficiency changed toward higher. The insights provided by our analysis reveal ways to reduce carbon emission. Based on the carbon footprints of the 28 sectors, we propose how managers could adjust its energy consumption structure to decrease energy consumption and carbon emission.},

abstract = {Shandong Province's Lubei eco-industrial park was established early, developed well, and began earning high profits, and has been recognized around the world as a successful example of this type of park. Previous research on the metabolic processes for the elements that flow through eco-industrial parks has mainly accounted for the flows, stocks, and utilization efficiency of a few elements, but few studies have analyzed the complex internal characteristics of these metabolic processes by combining their structural and functional attributes. In this study, we analyzed the delivery and transformation processes and the internal characteristics of the industrial metabolic processes for sulfur in the Lubei eco-industrial park. By using network analysis, we were able to analyze the structural and functional characteristics of this network from the perspective of nodes (members of the network) and paths (flows between the nodes), and by combining an assessment of the characteristics of the nodes (degree, betweenness, closeness) and the paths (flow quantities and directions), we identified the key node (the cement clinker production), peripheral nodes (the ammonia and power plants), and key paths in the network (from the sulfuric acid plant to the ammonium phosphate plant, from the cement clinker production to the sulfuric acid plant, and from the ammonium phosphate plant to the cement clinker production). These results reveal the advantages and disadvantages of the Lubei eco-industrial park in terms of its structure and function, and suggest ways to improve the efficiency and the sustainable development of the park.},

Historically, groundwater level monitoring wells in Beijing Plain, China, were installed for assessing groundwater resources and for monitoring the cone of depression. Monitoring wells are clustered around well fields and urban areas. There is urgent need to upgrade the existing monitoring wells to a regional groundwater level monitoring network to acquire information for integrated water resources management. A new method was proposed for designing a regional groundwater level monitoring network. The method is based on groundwater regime zone mapping. Groundwater regime zone map delineates distinct areas of possible different groundwater level variations and is useful for locating groundwater monitoring wells. This method was applied to Beijing Plain to upgrade a regional groundwater level monitoring network.},

abstract = {An evaluation of interlinkages and synergies among the different resources and performance patterns in the city of Rome (Italy) was accomplished by means of decomposition equations, in order to identify the major drivers of change in the investigated period as well as future low-resource scenarios. A half-a-century historical series (1962–2008) of energy and resource consumption in the city of Rome (Italy) was investigated in order to ascertain the links between resource use and complexity change. Environmental, material and energy inputs were firstly evaluated as actual energy and mass flows, then converted to emergy units to provide an assessment on a common ground. Results show that the sustainability of the urban system decreased steadily in the investigated period, as confirmed by both intensive and extensive parameters. The demand for abiotic matter, water, energy and emergy (environmental work) was accounted for over time and referred to the population (per-capita indicators) and current prices economic product generated by the city (GVA, Gross Value Added). Moreover, the effects associated with the emissions were evaluated, with a special focus on global warming and acidification potential. The changes in the urban metabolism occurred within the investigated period were analyzed considering the variation of different inputs necessary to drive the city (electricity, fuels, goods, machineries, etc.). Finally, a decomposition analysis was performed to identify the main causes and drivers associated with the changes in the city metabolism. Decomposition results show that the increased fraction of imports compared to local sources, of non-renewable resources compared to renewables, as well as of population and per capita income not accompanied by sufficient increase of energy and material efficiency are the major drivers of such unsustainability pattern and call for policies that focus on optimization of production and consumption patterns in times of unavoidable shrinking of resource basis.},
