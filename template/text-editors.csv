Function,vi,Emacs
Keystroke execution,vi editing retains each permutation of typed keys . This creates a path in the decision tree which unambiguously identifies any command.,"Emacs commands are key combinations for which modifier keys are held down while other keys are pressed; a command gets executed once completely typed. This still forms a decision tree of commands, but not one of individual keystrokes ."
Memory usage and customizability,"Historically, vi is a smaller and faster program, but with less capacity for customization. The vim version of vi has evolved to provide significantly more functionality and customization than vi, making it comparable to Emacs [ notes 1 ] . vi start-up time is near instantaneous for small text files, while vim is almost as fast.","Emacs takes longer to start up (even compared to vim) and requires more memory . However, it is highly customizable and includes a large number of features, as it is essentially an execution environment for a Lisp program designed for text-editing."
User environment,"vi was originally exclusively used inside of a text-mode console, offering no graphical user interface (GUI). Most modern vi derivatives, e.g. MacVim and gVim, include GUIs. However, support for proportionally spaced fonts remains absent. Also lacking is support for different sized fonts in the same document.","Emacs, while also initially designed for use on a console, grew a GUI fairly early on due to its Lisp machine heritage. Current Emacs GUIs include full support for proportionate spacing and font-size variation."
Function/navigation interface,vi uses distinct editing modes .,Emacs uses metakey chords. [ notes 2 ]
Keyboard,"vi uses no <Alt> key and seldom uses the <Ctrl> key. So vi uses only most of the ""usual"" keys.","Emacs uses <Alt> and <Ctrl> keys, and observes the <Shift> variety regularly . Emacs uses all the usual keys regularly, which tends to encourage ambidextrous usage of their symmetry."
Language and script support,"vi has rudimentary support for languages other than English. Vim is partially multilingual, with support for European, Arabic, Hebrew, and Far East Asian language support only. Notably, Indic language and script support is absent.",Emacs has full support for all Unicode-compatible writing systems.
