# Plain text

The foundation of all good workflows.

1. Opens on any computer, in many easily available programs (without messing around with it!).
2. Lightweight.
3. Can be version controlled.
4. Can be operated on with code (searched, modified etc.).
	- For example, my systematic literature review.
5. Flowing from 4: it's a starting point to turn into many different formats (PDF, HTML etc.)

# Text editor

Notepad is the standard. Vim is brilliant:

1. Shortcuts (speed)
2. Plug-ins
	- Syntax colouring
3. Split-screen:
	- When in your text/code you want to copy from or refer to content elsewhere, without scrolling.

# Git

# LaTeX

1. WYSISYM vs. WYSIWYG
2. Have notes within your document source.
	- One reason: \url{http://retractionwatch.com/2014/11/11/overly-honest-references-should-we-cite-the-crappy-gabor-paper-here/}

# Markdown

1. Quick, simple note taking.
2. Turn notes into a published paper.
3. Turn into multiple versions. (See Plain text).

# R (not Excel!)

1. Reproducible.
2. Via knitr, it can be incorporated into LaTeX and Markdown.
